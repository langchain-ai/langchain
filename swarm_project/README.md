# LangGraph Swarm Project

This project implements a multi-agent swarm architecture using **LangGraph**. It features two specialized agents, an **Architect** and a **Tester**, who collaborate to generate and verify code artifacts.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The swarm consists of the following components:

*   **Architect Agent**: Responsible for writing code based on the mission objective. It uses the `write_code` tool to create artifacts.
*   **Tester Agent**: Responsible for verifying the code generated by the Architect. It uses the `run_test` tool to execute the code and report back with logs.
*   **Shared State**: A `SwarmState` that holds the message history, the current artifact, and iteration counters.
*   **Handoffs**: Agents can hand off control to each other (Architect -> Tester, Tester -> Architect) based on the state of the mission.

```

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already).

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment**:
    Open the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API Key:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_api_key_here
    ```

## 🏃 Usage

To start the swarm and run the default mission (creating a Fibonacci script):

```bash
python main.py
```

### Visual Mission Control

The project logs events to `swarm.log`. You can monitor the swarm's progress in real-time (like a dashboard) by running the following command in a separate terminal:

```bash
tail -f swarm.log
```

## 🛠️ Agents & Tools

### Agents
*   **Architect**: "You are the Architect. Write code and hand off to the Tester. Don't repeat failures."
*   **Tester**: "You are the Tester. If code fails, hand back to Architect with logs. If it passes, say 'MISSION_COMPLETE'."

### Tools
*   **`write_code(file_path, content)`**: Writes text content to a specified file.
*   **`run_test(command)`**: Executes a shell command and returns stdout/stderr.

## 🔄 Workflow

1.  **User** provides an objective (e.g., "Create a Python script that calculates Fibonacci").
2.  **Architect** receives the objective, writes the code using `write_code`, and hands off to the **Tester**.
3.  **Tester** receives the signal, runs the code using `run_test`, and evaluates the output.
    *   If **Success**: The Tester declares "MISSION_COMPLETE".
    *   If **Failure**: The Tester hands back to the **Architect** with error logs.
4.  **Architect** iterates on the code based on the feedback until the mission is complete or the recursion limit is reached.
