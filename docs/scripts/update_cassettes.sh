# Use this script to update cassettes for a notebook. The script does the following:
#
# 1. Delete existing cassettes for the specified notebook
# 2. Pre-download and cache nltk and tiktoken files
# 3. Modify the notebook to generate cassettes for each cell.
# 4. Execute the notebook.
#
# Important: make sure the notebook is in a clean state, with any desired changes
# staged or committed. The script will modify the notebook in place, and these
# modifications should be discarded after the cassettes are generated.
#
# Usage:
# In monorepo env, `uv sync --group dev --group test`
# `./docs/scripts/update_cassettes.sh path/to/notebook`
# e.g., `./docs/scripts/update_cassettes.sh docs/docs/how_to/tool_choice.ipynb`
#
# Make sure to set any env vars required by the notebook.
