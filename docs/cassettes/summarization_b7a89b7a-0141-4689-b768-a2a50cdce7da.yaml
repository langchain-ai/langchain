      agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.
      Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI,
      serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating
      well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful
      general problem solver.\nAgent System Overview#\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous
      agent system, LLM functions as the agent\u2019s brain, complemented by several
      key components:\n\nPlanning\n\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down
      large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of
      complex tasks.\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and
      self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future
      steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\n\n\nMemory\n\nShort-term
      memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering)
      as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\nLong-term memory: This
      provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information
      over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast
      retrieval.\n\n\nTool use\n\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra
      information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after
      pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access
      to proprietary information sources and more.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 1. Overview of a
      LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\nComponent One: Planning#\nA complicated
      task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan
      ahead.\nTask Decomposition#\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become
      a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks.
      The model is instructed to \u201cthink step by step\u201d to utilize more test-time
      computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms
      big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation
      of the model\u2019s thinking process.\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends
      CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes
      the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per
      step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first
      search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier
      (via a prompt) or majority vote.\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM
      with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals
      for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write
      a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\nAnother quite
      distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external
      classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning
      Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the
      planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into \u201cProblem
      PDDL\u201d, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based
      on an existing \u201cDomain PDDL\u201d, and finally (3) translates the PDDL
      plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced
      to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a
      suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other
      domains.\nSelf-Reflection#\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous
      agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting
      previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and
      error are inevitable.\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting
      within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific
      discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact
      with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting
      LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\nThe ReAct prompt template
      incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\nThought:
      ...\nAction: ...\nObservation: ...\n... (Repeated many times)\n\nFig. 2.  Examples
      of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER)
      and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et
      al. 2023).\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making
      tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: \u2026 step
      is removed.\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents
      with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills.
      Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple
      binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific
      action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After
      each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide
      to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection
      results.\n\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory
      is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient
      planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination
      is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that
      lead to the same observation in the environment.\nSelf-reflection is created
      by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory,
      ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are
      added into the agent\u2019s working memory, up to three, to be used as context
      for querying LLM.\n\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination
      is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages
      the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence
      of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection
      of $D_h = \\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each
      $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is
      the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples
      are ranked by reward, $r_n \\geq r_{n-1} \\geq \\dots \\geq r_1$ The process
      is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\tau_h
      = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\leq i \\leq j \\leq n$.
      The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence
      prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based
      on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of
      instructions with human annotators at test time.\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH
      adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training
      dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words
      in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\nThe
      training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons,
      summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\n\nFig. 5. After
      fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with
      incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\nThe
      idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context
      and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm
      Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode
      trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated
      in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with
      the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better,
      AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we
      should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous
      trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific
      policy itself.\n\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works.
      (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm
      that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network
      by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated
      by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training
      stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode
      history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\nIn
      reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be
      short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of
      2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm.
      The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\nIn comparison
      with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with
      expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating
      trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper
      bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance
      getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than
      other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source
      policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\n\nFig. 7. Comparison
      of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration.
      Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for
      \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\nComponent
      Two: Memory#\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I\u2019ve
      learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations
      with ChatGPT.)\nTypes of Memory#\nMemory can be defined as the processes used
      to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several
      types of memory in human brains.\n\n\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage
      of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information
      (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory
      typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory
      (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\n\n\nShort-Term
      Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently
      aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and
      reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items
      (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\n\n\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term
      memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few
      days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two
      subtypes of LTM:\n\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and
      events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including
      episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\nImplicit
      / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills
      and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing
      on a keyboard.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\nWe can roughly
      consider the following mappings:\n\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations
      for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\nShort-term memory
      as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite
      context window length of Transformer.\nLong-term memory as the external vector
      store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\n\nMaximum
      Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction
      of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation
      of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product
      search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate
      nearest neighbors (ANN)\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest
      neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\nA couple
      common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\n\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing):
      It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to
      the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much
      smaller than the number of inputs.\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh
      Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary
      trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space
      into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently
      and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search
      happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest
      to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD
      tree but a lot more scalable.\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It
      is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached
      by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. \u201csix degrees of
      separation\u201d feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers
      of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data
      points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing
      a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards
      the target. When it can\u2019t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer,
      until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially
      cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers
      refines the search quality.\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates
      on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow
      a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points.
      FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters
      and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster
      candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster
      with finer quantization.\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation
      in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$
      to $\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\langle q, x_i \\rangle$ is
      as similar to the original distance of $\\angle q, \\tilde{x}_i$ as possible,
      instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\n\n\nFig. 9. Comparison

      Three: Tool Use#\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic
      of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things
      that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external
      tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\n\nFig. 10. A picture
      of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water.
      While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with
      humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short
      for \u201cModular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language\u201d, is a neuro-symbolic
      architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection
      of \u201cexpert\u201d modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router
      to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be
      neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency
      converter, weather API).\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call
      a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that
      it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems
      because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments
      for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic
      tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial,
      determined by the LLM capability.\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models;
      Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn
      to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly
      added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more
      details in the \u201cExternal APIs\u201d section of Prompt Engineering.\nChatGPT
      Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented
      with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can
      be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function
      calls).\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the
      task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to
      the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\n\nFig.
      11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\nThe
      system comprises of 4 stages:\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and
      parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated
      with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot
      examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\nInstruction:\n\nThe
      AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\",
      task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\":
      URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of
      the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies
      on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and
      video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from
      the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship
      between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can''t be parsed,
      you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{
      Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From
      this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for
      your task planning.\n\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert
      models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented
      with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task
      type based filtration is needed.\nInstruction:\n\nGiven the user request and
      the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model
      from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs
      the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON
      format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We
      have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please
      select one model from the list.\n\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute
      on the specific tasks and log results.\nInstruction:\n\nWith the input and the
      inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results.
      The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning:
      {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions
      }}. You must first answer the user''s request in a straightforward manner. Then
      describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results
      to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must
      tell the user the complete file path.\n\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives
      the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\nTo put HuggingGPT
      into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement
      is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow
      down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over
      complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external
      model services.\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the
      performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools,
      a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve
      568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines,
      calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health
      data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are
      a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the
      right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\n\nFig.
      12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li
      et al. 2023)\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions
      and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\n\nWhether
      an API call is needed.\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough,
      LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords
      for Search Engine API).\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose
      to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\n\nThis benchmark evaluates
      the agent\u2019s tool use capabilities at three levels:\n\nLevel-1 evaluates
      the ability to call the API. Given an API\u2019s description, the model needs
      to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly
      to API returns.\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model
      needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user\u2019s requirement
      and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\nLevel-3 assesses the ability
      to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule
      group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have
      to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\n\nCase Studies#\nScientific Discovery
      Agent#\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM
      is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic
      synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in
      LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and
      combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\n\nThe LLM is provided
      with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about
      the expected input/output.\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt
      using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model
      to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\n\nOne
      interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that
      GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts
      oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed
      that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential
      problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires
      deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and
      thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\nBoiko et al. (2023)
      also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous
      design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent
      can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call
      robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\nFor example, when requested
      to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following
      reasoning steps:\n\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\nselected
      a target;\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\nOnce the compound
      was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\n\nThey also discussed the
      risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set
      containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize
      them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution
      and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7
      out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a
      Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\nGenerative
      Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters,
      each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox
      environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra
      of human behavior for interactive applications.\nThe design of generative agents
      combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents
      to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other
      agents.\n\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that
      records a comprehensive list of agents\u2019 experience in natural language.\n\nEach
      element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\n- Inter-agent
      communication can trigger new natural language statements.\n\n\nRetrieval model:
      surfaces the context to inform the agent\u2019s behavior, according to relevance,
      recency and importance.\n\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\nImportance:
      distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\nRelevance: based on
      how related it is to the current situation / query.\n\n\nReflection mechanism:
      synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent\u2019s
      future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that
      this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\n\nPrompt LM with 100 most
      recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given
      a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\n\n\nPlanning
      & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\n\nPlanning
      is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\nPrompt
      template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X''s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\nRelationships
      between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration
      for planning and reacting.\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\n\n\n\n\nFig.
      13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\nThis
      fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion,
      relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and
      coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\nProof-of-Concept
      Examples#\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting
      up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of
      reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a
      cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\nHere

      going through key ideas and demos of building LLM-centered agents, I start to
      see a couple common limitations:\n\n\nFinite context length: The restricted
      context capacity limits the inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions,
      API call context, and responses. The design of the system has to work with this
      limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn
      from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows.
      Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge
      pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\n\n\nChallenges
      in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history
      and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle
      to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared
      to humans who learn from trial and error.\n\n\nReliability of natural language
      interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between
      LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability
      of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally
      exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently,
      much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\n\n\nCitation#\nCited
