# Prompt templates

Prompt templates are pre-defined recipes for generating prompts for language models.

A template may include instructions, few-shot examples, and specific context and
questions appropriate for a given task.

LangChain provides tooling to create and work with prompt templates.

LangChain strives to create model agnostic templates to make it easy to reuse
existing templates across different language models.
