The next step after calling a language model is make a series of calls to a language model. This is particularly useful when you want to take the output from one call and use it as the input to another.

In this notebook we will walk through some examples for how to do this, using sequential chains. Sequential chains allow you to connect multiple chains and compose them into pipelines that execute some specific scenario.. There are two types of sequential chains:

- `SimpleSequentialChain`: The simplest form of sequential chains, where each step has a singular input/output, and the output of one step is the input to the next.
- `SequentialChain`: A more general form of sequential chains, allowing for multiple inputs/outputs.
