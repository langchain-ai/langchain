# Structured tool chat agent

This notebook walks through using a chat agent capable of using multi-input tools.

Older agents are configured to specify an action input as a single string, but this agent can use the provided tools' `args_schema` to populate the action input.

This functionality is natively available in the (`structured-chat-zero-shot-react-description` or `AgentType.STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION`).
