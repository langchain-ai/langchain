# Conversation Agent (for Chat Models)

This walkthrough demonstrates how to use an agent optimized for conversation, using ChatModels. Other agents are often optimized for using tools to figure out the best response, which is not ideal in a conversational setting where you may want the agent to be able to chat with the user as well.

This is accomplished with a specific type of agent (`chat-conversational-react-description`) which expects to be used with a memory component.
