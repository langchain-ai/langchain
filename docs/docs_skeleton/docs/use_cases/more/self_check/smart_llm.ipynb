    "# How to use a SmartLLMChain\n",
    "\n",
    "A SmartLLMChain is a form of self-critique chain that can help you if have particularly complex questions to answer. Instead of doing a single LLM pass, it instead performs these 3 steps:\n",
    "1. Ideation: Pass the user prompt n times through the LLM to get n output proposals (called \"ideas\"), where n is a parameter you can set \n",
    "2. Critique: The LLM critiques all ideas to find possible flaws and picks the best one \n",
    "3. Resolve: The LLM tries to improve upon the best idea (as chosen in the critique step) and outputs it. This is then the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SmartLLMChains are based on the SmartGPT workflow proposed in https://youtu.be/wVzuvf9D9BU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that SmartLLMChains\n",
    "- use more LLM passes (ie n+2 instead of just 1)\n",
    "- only work then the underlying LLM has the capability for reflection, whicher smaller models often don't\n",
    "- only work with underlying models that return exactly 1 output, not multiple\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use a SmartLLMChain."
