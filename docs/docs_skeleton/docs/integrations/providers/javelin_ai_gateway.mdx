# Javelin AI Gateway

[The Javelin AI Gateway](https://www.getjavelin.io) service is a high-performance, enterprise grade API Gateway for AI applications.  
It is designed to streamline the usage and access of various large language model (LLM) providers, 
such as OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic and custom large language models within an organization by incorporating
robust access security for all interactions with LLMs. 

Javelin offers a high-level interface that simplifies the interaction with LLMs by providing a unified endpoint 
to handle specific LLM related requests. 

See the Javelin AI Gateway [documentation](https://docs.getjavelin.io) for more details.  
[Javelin Python SDK](https://www.github.com/getjavelin/javelin-python) is an easy to use client library meant to be embedded into AI Applications

```python

from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.llms import JavelinAIGateway
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

route_completions = "eng_dept03"

gateway = JavelinAIGateway(
    gateway_uri="http://localhost:8000",
    route=route_completions,
    model_name="text-davinci-003",
)

llmchain = LLMChain(llm=gateway, prompt=prompt)
result = llmchain.run("podcast player")

print(result)

```

## Embeddings Example

```python
from langchain.embeddings import JavelinAIGatewayEmbeddings
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = JavelinAIGatewayEmbeddings(
    gateway_uri="http://localhost:8000",
    route="embeddings",
)

print(embeddings.embed_query("hello"))
print(embeddings.embed_documents(["hello"]))
```

## Chat Example
```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatJavelinAIGateway
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage

messages = [
    SystemMessage(
        content="You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."
    ),
    HumanMessage(
        content="Artificial Intelligence has the power to transform humanity and make the world a better place"
    ),
]

chat = ChatJavelinAIGateway(
    gateway_uri="http://localhost:8000",
    route="mychatbot_route",
    model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo"
    params={
        "temperature": 0.1
    }
)

print(chat(messages))
