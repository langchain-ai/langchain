# Beautiful Soup

>[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) is a Python package for parsing 
> HTML and XML documents (including having malformed markup, i.e. non-closed tags, so named after tag soup). 
> It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML,[3] which 
> is useful for web scraping.

## Installation and Setup

pip install beautifulsoup4
```

## Document Transformer
