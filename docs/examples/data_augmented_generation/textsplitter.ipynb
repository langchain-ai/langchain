    "1. Split the text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks (often sentences).\n",
    "2. Start combining these small chunks into a larger chunk until you reach a certain size (as measured by some function).\n",
    "3. Once you reach that size, make that chunk its own piece of text and then start creating a new chunk of text with some overlap (to keep context between chunks)."
