The speaker outlines the actions taken by the United States and its allies to hold Putin accountable, including economic sanctions, cutting off access to technology, and seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs. The speaker also announces the closing of American airspace to Russian flights, further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy. The Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended.
