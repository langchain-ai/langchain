    "# Agents\n",
    "Some applications will require not just a predetermined chain of calls to LLMs/other tools, but potentially an unknown chain that depends on the user input. In these types of chains, there is a \"agent\" (backed by an LLM) which has access to a suite of tools. Depending on the user input, the agent can then decide which, if any, of these tools to call.\n",
    "\n",
    "When used correctly agents can be extremely powerful. The purpose of this notebook is to show you how to easily use agents through the simplest, highest level API. If you want more low level control over various components, check out the documentation for custom agents (coming soon)."

    "In order to understand agents, you should understand the following concepts:\n",
    "- Tool: A function that performs a specific duty. This can be things like: Google Search, Database lookup, Python REPL, other chains. The interface for a tool is currently a function that is expected to have a string as an input, with a string as an output.\n",
    "- LLM: The language model powering the agent.\n",
    "- AgentType: The type of agent to use. This should be a string. For a list of supported agents, see here. Because this notebook focuses on the simplest, highest level API, this only covers using the standard supported agents. If you want to implement a custom agent, see the documentation for custom agents (coming soon)."
