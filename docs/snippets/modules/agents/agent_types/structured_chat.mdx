We will test the agent using a web browser.

from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import PlayWrightBrowserToolkit
from langchain.tools.playwright.utils import (
    create_async_playwright_browser,
    create_sync_playwright_browser, # A synchronous browser is available, though it isn't compatible with jupyter.
)

# This import is required only for jupyter notebooks, since they have their own eventloop
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()
```


```python
async_browser = create_async_playwright_browser()
browser_toolkit = PlayWrightBrowserToolkit.from_browser(async_browser=async_browser)
tools = browser_toolkit.get_tools()
```


```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) # Also works well with Anthropic models
agent_chain = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)

    LLM ops platforms, such as LangChain, make it easy to assemble LLM components (e.g., models, document retrievers, data loaders) into chains. Question-Answering is one of the most popular applications of these chains.
