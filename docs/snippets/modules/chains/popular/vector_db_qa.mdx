## Chain Type
You can easily specify different chain types to load and use in the RetrievalQA chain. For a more detailed walkthrough of these types, please see [this notebook](question_answering.ipynb).

There are two ways to load different chain types. First, you can specify the chain type argument in the `from_chain_type` method. This allows you to pass in the name of the chain type you want to use. For example, in the below we change the chain type to `map_reduce`.


```python
qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type="map_reduce", retriever=docsearch.as_retriever())
```


```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
qa.run(query)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    " The president said that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of our nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice and a former federal public defender, from a family of public school educators and police officers, a consensus builder and has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans."
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

The above way allows you to really simply change the chain_type, but it does provide a ton of flexibility over parameters to that chain type. If you want to control those parameters, you can load the chain directly (as you did in [this notebook](question_answering.ipynb)) and then pass that directly to the the RetrievalQA chain with the `combine_documents_chain` parameter. For example:


```python
from langchain.chains.question_answering import load_qa_chain
qa_chain = load_qa_chain(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type="stuff")
qa = RetrievalQA(combine_documents_chain=qa_chain, retriever=docsearch.as_retriever())
```


```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
qa.run(query)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    " The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators and police officers. He also said that she is a consensus builder and has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans."
```

## Custom Prompts
You can pass in custom prompts to do question answering. These prompts are the same prompts as you can pass into the [base question answering chain](./question_answering.ipynb)


```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
prompt_template = """Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

{context}

Question: {question}
Answer in Italian:"""
PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    template=prompt_template, input_variables=["context", "question"]
)
```


```python
chain_type_kwargs = {"prompt": PROMPT}
qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type="stuff", retriever=docsearch.as_retriever(), chain_type_kwargs=chain_type_kwargs)
```


```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
qa.run(query)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    " Il presidente ha detto che Ketanji Brown Jackson è una delle menti legali più importanti del paese, che continuerà l'eccellenza di Justice Breyer e che ha ricevuto un ampio sostegno, da Fraternal Order of Police a ex giudici nominati da democratici e repubblicani."
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## Return Source Documents
Additionally, we can return the source documents used to answer the question by specifying an optional parameter when constructing the chain.


```python
qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type="stuff", retriever=docsearch.as_retriever(), return_source_documents=True)
```


```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
result = qa({"query": query})
```


```python
result["result"]
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    " The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice and a former federal public defender from a family of public school educators and police officers, and that she has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans."
