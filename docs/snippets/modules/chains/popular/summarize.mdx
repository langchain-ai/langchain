## Prepare Data
First we prepare the data. For this example we create multiple documents from one long one, but these documents could be fetched in any manner (the point of this notebook to highlight what to do AFTER you fetch the documents).

```python
from langchain import OpenAI, PromptTemplate, LLMChain
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.chains.mapreduce import MapReduceChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter()
```


```python
with open("../../state_of_the_union.txt") as f:
    state_of_the_union = f.read()
texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)
```


```python
from langchain.docstore.document import Document

docs = [Document(page_content=t) for t in texts[:3]]
```

## Quickstart
If you just want to get started as quickly as possible, this is the recommended way to do it:


```python
from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain
```


```python
chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type="map_reduce")
chain.run(docs)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    ' In response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, the United States and its allies are taking action to hold Putin accountable, including economic sanctions, asset seizures, and military assistance. The US is also providing economic and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and has passed the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help struggling families and create jobs. The US remains unified and determined to protect Ukraine and the free world.'
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

If you want more control and understanding over what is happening, please see the information below.

## The `stuff` Chain

This sections shows results of using the `stuff` Chain to do summarization.


```python
chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type="stuff")
```


```python
chain.run(docs)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    ' In his speech, President Biden addressed the crisis in Ukraine, the American Rescue Plan, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. He discussed the need to invest in America, educate Americans, and build the economy from the bottom up. He also announced the release of 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world, and the creation of a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs. He concluded by emphasizing the need to Buy American and use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America.'
```

**Custom Prompts**

You can also use your own prompts with this chain. In this example, we will respond in Italian.


```python
prompt_template = """Write a concise summary of the following:


{text}


CONCISE SUMMARY IN ITALIAN:"""
PROMPT = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=["text"])
chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type="stuff", prompt=PROMPT)
chain.run(docs)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

Inoltre, ha annunciato che il Dipartimento di Giustizia degli Stati Uniti sta creando una task force dedicata ai crimini degli oligarchi russi. Il Presidente ha anche annunciato l'approvazione della legge bipartitica sull'infrastruttura, che prevede investimenti per la ricostruzione dell'America. Questo porterà a creare posti"

## The `map_reduce` Chain

This sections shows results of using the `map_reduce` Chain to do summarization.


```python
chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type="map_reduce")
```


```python
chain.run(docs)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    " In response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine, the United States and its allies have imposed economic sanctions and are taking other measures to hold Putin accountable. The US is also providing economic and military assistance to Ukraine, protecting NATO countries, and releasing oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. President Biden and Vice President Harris have passed legislation to help struggling families and rebuild America's infrastructure."
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

**Intermediate Steps**

We can also return the intermediate steps for `map_reduce` chains, should we want to inspect them. This is done with the `return_map_steps` variable.


```python
chain = load_summarize_chain(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type="map_reduce", return_intermediate_steps=True)
```


```python
chain({"input_documents": docs}, return_only_outputs=True)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

      ' The United States and its European allies are taking action to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, including seizing assets, closing off airspace, and providing economic and military assistance to Ukraine.
