## Prepare Data
First we prepare the data. For this example we do similarity search over a vector database, but these documents could be fetched in any manner (the point of this notebook to highlight what to do AFTER you fetch the documents).


```python
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.embeddings.cohere import CohereEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores.elastic_vector_search import ElasticVectorSearch
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.docstore.document import Document
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
```


```python
with open("../../state_of_the_union.txt") as f:
    state_of_the_union = f.read()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```


```python
docsearch = Chroma.from_texts(texts, embeddings, metadatas=[{"source": str(i)} for i in range(len(texts))])
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Running Chroma using direct local API.
    Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
query = "What did the president say about Justice Breyer"
docs = docsearch.similarity_search(query)
```


```python
from langchain.chains.qa_with_sources import load_qa_with_sources_chain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
```

## Quickstart
If you just want to get started as quickly as possible, this is the recommended way to do it:


```python
chain = load_qa_with_sources_chain(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type="stuff")
query = "What did the president say about Justice Breyer"
chain({"input_documents": docs, "question": query}, return_only_outputs=True)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'output_text': ' The president thanked Justice Breyer for his service.\nSOURCES: 30-pl'}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

If you want more control and understanding over what is happening, please see the information below.

## The `stuff` Chain

This sections shows results of using the `stuff` Chain to do question answering with sources.


```python
chain = load_qa_with_sources_chain(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type="stuff")
```


```python
query = "What did the president say about Justice Breyer"
chain({"input_documents": docs, "question": query}, return_only_outputs=True)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'output_text': ' The president thanked Justice Breyer for his service.\nSOURCES: 30-pl'}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

**Custom Prompts**

You can also use your own prompts with this chain. In this example, we will respond in Italian.


```python
template = """Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references ("SOURCES"). 
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Don't try to make up an answer.
ALWAYS return a "SOURCES" part in your answer.
Respond in Italian.

QUESTION: {question}
=========
{summaries}
=========
FINAL ANSWER IN ITALIAN:"""
PROMPT = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["summaries", "question"])

chain = load_qa_with_sources_chain(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type="stuff", prompt=PROMPT)
query = "What did the president say about Justice Breyer"
chain({"input_documents": docs, "question": query}, return_only_outputs=True)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'output_text': '\nNon so cosa abbia detto il presidente riguardo a Justice Breyer.\nSOURCES: 30, 31, 33'}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## The `map_reduce` Chain

This sections shows results of using the `map_reduce` Chain to do question answering with sources.


```python
chain = load_qa_with_sources_chain(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type="map_reduce")
```


```python
query = "What did the president say about Justice Breyer"
chain({"input_documents": docs, "question": query}, return_only_outputs=True)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'output_text': ' The president thanked Justice Breyer for his service.\nSOURCES: 30-pl'}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

**Intermediate Steps**

We can also return the intermediate steps for `map_reduce` chains, should we want to inspect them. This is done with the `return_intermediate_steps` variable.


```python
chain = load_qa_with_sources_chain(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type="map_reduce", return_intermediate_steps=True)
```


```python
chain({"input_documents": docs, "question": query}, return_only_outputs=True)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'intermediate_steps': [' "Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service."',
      ' None',
      ' None',
      ' None'],
     'output_text': ' The president thanked Justice Breyer for his service.\nSOURCES: 30-pl'}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

**Custom Prompts**

You can also use your own prompts with this chain. In this example, we will respond in Italian.


```python
question_prompt_template = """Use the following portion of a long document to see if any of the text is relevant to answer the question. 
Return any relevant text in Italian.
{context}
Question: {question}
Relevant text, if any, in Italian:"""
QUESTION_PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    template=question_prompt_template, input_variables=["context", "question"]
)

combine_prompt_template = """Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references ("SOURCES"). 
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Don't try to make up an answer.
ALWAYS return a "SOURCES" part in your answer.
Respond in Italian.

QUESTION: {question}
=========
{summaries}
=========
FINAL ANSWER IN ITALIAN:"""
COMBINE_PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    template=combine_prompt_template, input_variables=["summaries", "question"]
)

chain = load_qa_with_sources_chain(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type="map_reduce", return_intermediate_steps=True, question_prompt=QUESTION_PROMPT, combine_prompt=COMBINE_PROMPT)
chain({"input_documents": docs, "question": query}, return_only_outputs=True)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'intermediate_steps': ["\nStasera vorrei onorare qualcuno che ha dedicato la sua vita a servire questo paese: il giustizia Stephen Breyer - un veterano dell'esercito, uno studioso costituzionale e un giustizia in uscita della Corte Suprema degli Stati Uniti. Giustizia Breyer, grazie per il tuo servizio.",
      ' Non pertinente.',
      ' Non rilevante.',
      " Non c'è testo pertinente."],
     'output_text': ' Non conosco la risposta. SOURCES: 30, 31, 33, 20.'}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

**Batch Size**

When using the `map_reduce` chain, one thing to keep in mind is the batch size you are using during the map step. If this is too high, it could cause rate limiting errors. You can control this by setting the batch size on the LLM used. Note that this only applies for LLMs with this parameter. Below is an example of doing so:

```python
llm = OpenAI(batch_size=5, temperature=0)
```

## The `refine` Chain

This sections shows results of using the `refine` Chain to do question answering with sources.


```python
chain = load_qa_with_sources_chain(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type="refine")
```


```python
query = "What did the president say about Justice Breyer"
chain({"input_documents": docs, "question": query}, return_only_outputs=True)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'output_text': "\n\nThe president said that he was honoring Justice Breyer for his dedication to serving the country and that he was a retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

He noted Justice Breyer's reputation as a consensus builder and the broad range of support he has received from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. He also highlighted the importance of securing the border and fixing the immigration system in order to advance liberty and justice, and mentioned the new technology, joint patrols, dedicated immigration judges, and commitments to support partners in South and Central America that have been put in place. He also expressed his commitment to the LGBTQ+ community, noting the need for the bipartisan Equality Act and the importance of protecting transgender Americans from state laws targeting them. He also highlighted his commitment to bipartisanship, noting the 80 bipartisan bills he signed into law last year, and his plans to strengthen the Violence Against Women Act.
