    "## Use case\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthetic data is artificially generated data, rather than data collected from real-world events. It's used to simulate real data without compromising privacy or encountering real-world limitations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of Synthetic Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Privacy and Security**: No real personal data at risk of breaches.\n",
    "2. **Data Augmentation**: Expands datasets for machine learning.\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: Create specific or rare scenarios.\n",
    "4. **Cost-effective**: Often cheaper than real-world data collection.\n",
    "5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Helps navigate strict data protection laws.\n",
    "6. **Model Robustness**: Can lead to better generalizing AI models.\n",
    "7. **Rapid Prototyping**: Enables quick testing without real data.\n",
    "8. **Controlled Experimentation**: Simulate specific conditions.\n",
    "9. **Access to Data**: Alternative when real data isn't available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Despite the benefits, synthetic data should be used carefully, as it may not always capture real-world complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll dive deep into generating synthetic medical billing records using the langchain library. This tool is particularly useful when you want to develop or test algorithms but don't want to use real patient data due to privacy concerns or data availability issues."

Since this is an experimental lib, we'll need to include `langchain_experimental` in our installs. We'll then import the necessary modules."
