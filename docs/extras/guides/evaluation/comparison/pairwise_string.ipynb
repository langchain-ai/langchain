    "# Pairwise String Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you will want to compare predictions of an LLM, Chain, or Agent for a given input. The `StringComparison` evaluators facilitate this so you can answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which LLM or prompt produces a preferred output for a given question?\n",
    "- Which examples should I include for few-shot example selection?\n",
    "- Which output is better to include for fintetuning?\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest and often most reliable automated way to choose a preferred prediction for a given input is to use the `pairwise_string` evaluator.\n",
