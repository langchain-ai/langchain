# Annoy

> [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) (`Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah`) is a C++ library with Python bindings to search for points in space that are close to a given query point. It also creates large read-only file-based data structures that are mmapped into memory so that many processes may share the same data.

pip install annoy
```
