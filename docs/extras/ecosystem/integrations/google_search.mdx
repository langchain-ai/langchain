# Google Search

This page covers how to use the Google Search API within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to the specific Google Search wrapper.

## Installation and Setup
- Install requirements with `pip install google-api-python-client`
- Set up a Custom Search Engine, following [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37083058/programmatically-searching-google-in-python-using-custom-search)
- Get an API Key and Custom Search Engine ID from the previous step, and set them as environment variables `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` respectively

## Wrappers

### Utility

There exists a GoogleSearchAPIWrapper utility which wraps this API. To import this utility:

```python
from langchain.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of this wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/modules/agents/tools/integrations/google_search.html).

### Tool

You can also easily load this wrapper as a Tool (to use with an Agent).
You can do this with:
```python
from langchain.agents import load_tools
tools = load_tools(["google-search"])
```

For more information on tools, see [this page](/docs/modules/agents/tools/).
