# Cassandra

>[Apache Cassandra®](https://cassandra.apache.org/) is a free and open-source, distributed, wide-column 
> store, NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, 
> providing high availability with no single point of failure. Cassandra offers support for clusters spanning 
> multiple datacenters, with asynchronous masterless replication allowing low latency operations for all clients. 
> Cassandra was designed to implement a combination of _Amazon's Dynamo_ distributed storage and replication 
> techniques combined with _Google's Bigtable_ data and storage engine model.
