# Brave Search


>[Brave Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_Search) is a search engine developed by Brave Software.
> - `Brave Search` uses its own web index. As of May 2022, it covered over 10 billion pages and was used to serve 92% 
> of search results without relying on any third-parties, with the remainder being retrieved 
> server-side from the Bing API or (on an opt-in basis) client-side from Google. According 
> to Brave, the index was kept "intentionally smaller than that of Google or Bing" in order to 
> help avoid spam and other low-quality content, with the disadvantage that "Brave Search is 
> not yet as good as Google in recovering long-tail queries."
>- `Brave Search Premium`: As of April 2023 Brave Search is an ad-free website, but it will 
> eventually switch to a new model that will include ads and premium users will get an ad-free experience.
> User data including IP addresses won't be collected from its users by default. A premium account 
> will be required for opt-in data-collection.
