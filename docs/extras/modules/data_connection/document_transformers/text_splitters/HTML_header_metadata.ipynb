    "## Description and motivation\n",
    "Similar in concept to the <a href=\"https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/text_splitters/markdown_header_metadata\">`MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter`</a>, the `HTMLHeaderTextSplitter` is a \"structure-aware\" chunker that splits text at the element level and adds metadata for each header \"relevant\" to any given chunk. It can return chunks element by element or combine elements with the same metadata, with the objectives of (a) keeping related text grouped (more or less) semantically and (b) preserving context-rich information encoded in document structures. It can be used with other text splitters as part of a chunking pipeline.\n",

    "There can be quite a bit of structural variation from one HTML document to another, and while `HTMLHeaderTextSplitter` will attempt to attach all \"relevant\" headers to any given chunk, it can sometimes miss certain headers. For example, the algorithm assumes an informational hierarchy in which headers are always at nodes \"above\" associated text, i.e. prior siblings, ancestors, and combinations thereof. In the following news article (as of the writing of this document), the document is structured such that the text of the top-level headline, while tagged \"h1\", is in a *distinct* subtree from the text elements that we'd expect it to be *\"above\"*&mdash;so we can observe that the \"h1\" element and its associated text do not show up in the chunk metadata (but, where applicable, we do see \"h2\" and its associated text):   \n"
