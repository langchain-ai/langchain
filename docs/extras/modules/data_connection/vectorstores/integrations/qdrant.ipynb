    ">[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/) (read: quadrant ) is a vector similarity search engine. It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points - vectors with an additional payload. `Qdrant` is tailored to extended filtering support. It makes it useful for all sorts of neural network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the `Qdrant` vector database. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are various modes of how to run `Qdrant`, and depending on the chosen one, there will be some subtle differences. The options include:\n",
    "- Local mode, no server required\n",
    "- On-premise server deployment\n",
    "- Qdrant Cloud\n",
