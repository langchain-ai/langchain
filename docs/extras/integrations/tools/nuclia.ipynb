    "[Nuclia](https://nuclia.com) automatically indexes your unstructured data from any internal and external source, providing optimized search results and generative answers. It can handle video and audio transcription, image content extraction, and document parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Nuclia Understanding API supports the processing of unstructured data, including text, web pages, documents, and audio/video contents. It extracts all texts wherever it is (using speech-to-text or OCR when needed), it identifies entities, it aslo extracts metadata, embedded files (like images in a PDF), and web links. It also provides a summary of the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Nuclia Understanding API, you need to have a Nuclia account. You can create one for free at [https://nuclia.cloud](https://nuclia.cloud), and then [create a NUA key](https://docs.nuclia.dev/docs/docs/using/understanding/intro)."
