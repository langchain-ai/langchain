    "# PromptGuard\n",
    "\n",
    "[PromptGuard](https://promptguard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a service that enables applications to leverage the power of language models without compromising user privacy. Designed for composability and ease of integration into existing applications and services, PromptGuard is consumable via a simple Python library as well as through LangChain. Perhaps more importantly, PromptGuard leverages the power of [confidential computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidential_computing) to ensure that even the PromptGuard service itself cannot access the data it is protecting.\n",
