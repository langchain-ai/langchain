# TensorFlow Datasets

>[TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets) is a collection of datasets ready to use, 
> with TensorFlow or other Python ML frameworks, such as Jax. All datasets are exposed 
> as [tf.data.Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset), 
> enabling easy-to-use and high-performance input pipelines. To get started see 
> the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/overview) and 
> the [list of datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview#all_datasets).
