# Golden

>[Golden](https://golden.com) provides a set of natural language APIs for querying and enrichment using the Golden Knowledge Graph e.g. queries such as: `Products from OpenAI`, `Generative ai companies with series a funding`, and `rappers who invest` can be used to retrieve structured data about relevant entities.
>
>The `golden-query` langchain tool is a wrapper on top of the [Golden Query API](https://docs.golden.com/reference/query-api) which enables programmatic access to these results.
>See the [Golden Query API docs](https://docs.golden.com/reference/query-api) for more information.

For a more detailed walkthrough of this wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/tools/golden_query.html).
