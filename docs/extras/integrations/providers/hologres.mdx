# Hologres

>[Hologres](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/hologres/latest/introduction) is a unified real-time data warehousing service developed by Alibaba Cloud. You can use Hologres to write, update, process, and analyze large amounts of data in real time. 
>`Hologres` supports standard `SQL` syntax, is compatible with `PostgreSQL`, and supports most PostgreSQL functions. Hologres supports online analytical processing (OLAP) and ad hoc analysis for up to petabytes of data, and provides high-concurrency and low-latency online data services. 

>`Hologres` provides **vector database** functionality by adopting [Proxima](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/hologres/latest/vector-processing).
>`Proxima` is a high-performance software library developed by `Alibaba DAMO Academy`. It allows you to search for the nearest neighbors of vectors. Proxima provides higher stability and performance than similar open source software such as Faiss. Proxima allows you to search for similar text or image embeddings with high throughput and low latency. Hologres is deeply integrated with Proxima to provide a high-performance vector search service.
