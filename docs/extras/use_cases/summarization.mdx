# Summarization

Summarization involves creating a smaller summary of multiple longer documents.
This can be useful for distilling long documents into the core pieces of information.

The recommended way to get started using a summarization chain is:

```python
from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain
chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type="map_reduce")
chain.run(docs)
```

The following resources exist:
- [Summarization notebook](/docs/modules/chains/popular/summarize.html): A notebook walking through how to accomplish this task.
