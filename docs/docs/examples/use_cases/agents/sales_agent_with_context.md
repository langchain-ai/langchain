# SalesGPT - Your Context-Aware AI Sales Assistant

This notebook demonstrates an implementation of a **Context-Aware** AI Sales agent. 

This notebook was originally published at [filipmichalsky/SalesGPT](https://github.com/filip-michalsky/SalesGPT) by [@FilipMichalsky](https://twitter.com/FilipMichalsky).

SalesGPT is context-aware, which means it can understand what section of a sales conversation it is in and act accordingly.
 
As such, this agent can have a natural sales conversation with a prospect and behaves based on the conversation stage. Hence, this notebook demonstrates how we can use AI to automate sales development representatives activites, such as outbound sales calls. 

We leverage the [`langchain`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) library in this implementation and are inspired by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) architecture .

## Import Libraries and Set Up Your Environment


```python
import os

# import your OpenAI key -
# you need to put it in your .env file 
# OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-xxxx'

os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'sk-xxx'

from typing import Dict, List, Any

from langchain import LLMChain, PromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import BaseLLM
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from langchain.chains.base import Chain
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
```

### SalesGPT architecture

1. Seed the SalesGPT agent
2. Run Sales Agent
3. Run Sales Stage Recognition Agent to recognize which stage is the sales agent at and adjust their behaviour accordingly.

Here is the schematic of the architecture:

### Sales conversation stages.

The agent employs an assistant who keeps it in check as in what stage of the conversation it is in. These stages were generated by ChatGPT and can be easily modified to fit other use cases or modes of conversation.

1. Introduction: Start the conversation by introducing yourself and your company. Be polite and respectful while keeping the tone of the conversation professional.

2. Qualification: Qualify the prospect by confirming if they are the right person to talk to regarding your product/service. Ensure that they have the authority to make purchasing decisions.

3. Value proposition: Briefly explain how your product/service can benefit the prospect. Focus on the unique selling points and value proposition of your product/service that sets it apart from competitors.

4. Needs analysis: Ask open-ended questions to uncover the prospect's needs and pain points. Listen carefully to their responses and take notes.

5. Solution presentation: Based on the prospect's needs, present your product/service as the solution that can address their pain points.

6. Objection handling: Address any objections that the prospect may have regarding your product/service. Be prepared to provide evidence or testimonials to support your claims.

7. Close: Ask for the sale by proposing a next step. This could be a demo, a trial or a meeting with decision-makers. Ensure to summarize what has been discussed and reiterate the benefits.



```python
class StageAnalyzerChain(LLMChain):
    """Chain to analyze which conversation stage should the conversation move into."""

            7. Close: Ask for the sale by proposing a next step. This could be a demo, a trial or a meeting with decision-makers. Ensure to summarize what has been discussed and reiterate the benefits.

            Only answer with a number between 1 through 7 with a best guess of what stage should the conversation continue with. 
            The answer needs to be one number only, no words.
            If there is no conversation history, output 1.
