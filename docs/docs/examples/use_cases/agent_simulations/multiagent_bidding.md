# Multi-agent decentralized speaker selection

This notebook showcases how to implement a multi-agent simulation without a fixed schedule for who speaks when. Instead the agents decide for themselves who speaks. We can implement this by having each agent bid to speak. Whichever agent's bid is the highest gets to speak.

We will show how to do this in the example below that showcases a fictitious presidential debate.

## `DialogueAgent` and `DialogueSimulator` classes
We will use the same `DialogueAgent` and `DialogueSimulator` classes defined in [Multi-Player Dungeons & Dragons](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/agent_simulations/multi_player_dnd.html).


```python
class DialogueAgent:
    def __init__(
        self,
        name: str,
        system_message: SystemMessage,
        model: ChatOpenAI,
    ) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.system_message = system_message
        self.model = model
        self.prefix = f"{self.name}: "
        self.reset()
        
    def reset(self):
        self.message_history = ["Here is the conversation so far."]

    def send(self) -> str:
        """

                self.system_message,
                HumanMessage(content="\n".join(self.message_history + [self.prefix])),
            ]
        )
        return message.content

    def receive(self, name: str, message: str) -> None:
        """
        Concatenates {message} spoken by {name} into message history

        self.message_history.append(f"{name}: {message}")


class DialogueSimulator:
    def __init__(
        self,
        agents: List[DialogueAgent],
        selection_function: Callable[[int, List[DialogueAgent]], int],
    ) -> None:
        self.agents = agents
        self._step = 0
        self.select_next_speaker = selection_function
        
    def reset(self):
        for agent in self.agents:
            agent.reset()

    def inject(self, name: str, message: str):
        """

    def step(self) -> tuple[str, str]:
        # 1. choose the next speaker
        speaker_idx = self.select_next_speaker(self._step, self.agents)
        speaker = self.agents[speaker_idx]

        # 2. next speaker sends message
        message = speaker.send()

        # 3. everyone receives message
        for receiver in self.agents:
            receiver.receive(speaker.name, message)

        # 4. increment time
        self._step += 1

        return speaker.name, message
```

## `BiddingDialogueAgent` class
We define a subclass of `DialogueAgent` that has a `bid()` method that produces a bid given the message history and the most recent message.


```python
class BiddingDialogueAgent(DialogueAgent):
    def __init__(
        self,
        name,
        system_message: SystemMessage,
        bidding_template: PromptTemplate,

    ) -> None:
        super().__init__(name, system_message, model)
        self.bidding_template = bidding_template
        
    def bid(self) -> str:
        """
        Asks the chat model to output a bid to speak
        """
        prompt = PromptTemplate(
            input_variables=['message_history', 'recent_message'],
            template = self.bidding_template
        ).format(
            message_history='\n'.join(self.message_history),
            recent_message=self.message_history[-1])
        bid_string = self.model([SystemMessage(content=prompt)]).content
        return bid_string
```

## Output parser for bids
We ask the agents to output a bid to speak. But since the agents are LLMs that output strings, we need to 
1. define a format they will produce their outputs in
2. parse their outputs

We can subclass the [RegexParser](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/output_parsers/regex.py) to implement our own custom output parser for bids.


```python
class BidOutputParser(RegexParser):
    def get_format_instructions(self) -> str:
        return 'Your response should be an integer delimited by angled brackets, like this: <int>.'     
    
bid_parser = BidOutputParser(
    regex=r'<(\d+)>', 
    output_keys=['bid'],
    default_output_key='bid')
```

## Generate bidding system message
This is inspired by the prompt used in [Generative Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf) for using an LLM to determine the importance of memories. This will use the formatting instructions from our `BidOutputParser`.


```python
def generate_character_bidding_template(character_header):
    bidding_template = (
    f"""{character_header}

```
{{message_history}}
```

On the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not contradictory and 10 is extremely contradictory, rate how contradictory the following message is to your ideas.

```
{{recent_message}}
```

{bid_parser.get_format_instructions()}
Do nothing else.
    """)
    return bidding_template

character_bidding_templates = [generate_character_bidding_template(character_header) for character_header in character_headers]
```


```python
for character_name, bidding_template in zip(character_names, character_bidding_templates):
    print(f'{character_name} Bidding Template:')
    print(bidding_template)
```

## Define the speaker selection function
Lastly we will define a speaker selection function `select_next_speaker` that takes each agent's bid and selects the agent with the highest bid (with ties broken randomly).

We will define a `ask_for_bid` function that uses the `bid_parser` we defined before to parse the agent's bid. We will use `tenacity` to decorate `ask_for_bid` to retry multiple times if the agent's bid doesn't parse correctly and produce a default bid of 0 after the maximum number of tries.


```python
@tenacity.retry(stop=tenacity.stop_after_attempt(2),
                    wait=tenacity.wait_none(),  # No waiting time between retries
                    retry=tenacity.retry_if_exception_type(ValueError),
                    before_sleep=lambda retry_state: print(f"ValueError occurred: {retry_state.outcome.exception()}, retrying..."),
                    retry_error_callback=lambda retry_state: 0) # Default value when all retries are exhausted
def ask_for_bid(agent) -> str:
    """
    Ask for agent bid and parses the bid into the correct format.
    """
    bid_string = agent.bid()
    bid = int(bid_parser.parse(bid_string)['bid'])
    return bid
```


```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_speaker(step: int, agents: List[DialogueAgent]) -> int:
    bids = []
    for agent in agents:
        bid = ask_for_bid(agent)

I'll make sure we cut through the red tape and get the job done. And let me tell you, we'll make it profitable too. We'll bring in private investors and make sure it's a win-win for everyone. *gestures confidently*

    (Elizabeth Warren): Thank you for the question. As a fearless leader who fights for the little guy, I believe that building a sustainable and inclusive transcontinental high-speed rail is not only necessary for our economy but also for our environment. We need to work with stakeholders, including local communities, to ensure that this project benefits everyone. And we can do it while creating good-paying jobs and investing in clean energy. *smiles confidently*

    (Donald Trump): Let me tell you, Elizabeth, you're all talk and no action. We need a leader who knows how to get things done, not just talk about it. And as for the environment, I've got a great idea. We'll make the trains run on clean coal. That's right, folks, clean coal. It's a beautiful thing. And we'll make sure the rail system is the envy of the world. *thumbs up*

    (Kanye West): Yo, yo, yo, let me tell you something. This high-speed rail project is the future, and I'm all about the future. We need to think big and think outside the box. How about we make the trains run on solar power? That's right, solar power. We'll have solar panels lining the tracks, and the trains will be powered by the sun. It's a game-changer, folks. And we'll make sure the design is sleek and modern, like a work of art. *starts to dance*

    (Donald Trump): Kanye, you're a great artist, but this is about practicality. Solar power is too expensive and unreliable. We need to focus on what works, and that's clean coal. And as for the design, we'll make it beautiful, but we won't sacrifice efficiency for aesthetics. We need a leader who knows how to balance both. *stands tall*
