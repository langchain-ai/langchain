# CAMEL Role-Playing Autonomous Cooperative Agents

This is a langchain implementation of paper: "CAMEL: Communicative Agents for “Mind” Exploration of Large Scale Language Model Society".

Overview:

The rapid advancement of conversational and chat-based language models has led to remarkable progress in complex task-solving. However, their success heavily relies on human input to guide the conversation, which can be challenging and time-consuming. This paper explores the potential of building scalable techniques to facilitate autonomous cooperation among communicative agents and provide insight into their "cognitive" processes. To address the challenges of achieving autonomous cooperation, we propose a novel communicative agent framework named role-playing. Our approach involves using inception prompting to guide chat agents toward task completion while maintaining consistency with human intentions. We showcase how role-playing can be used to generate conversational data for studying the behaviors and capabilities of chat agents, providing a valuable resource for investigating conversational language models. Our contributions include introducing a novel communicative agent framework, offering a scalable approach for studying the cooperative behaviors and capabilities of multi-agent systems, and open-sourcing our library to support research on communicative agents and beyond.

    AI Assistant (Python Programmer):
    
    Solution: We can calculate the short-term and long-term moving averages for the stock data using the `ta.SMA()` function from ta-lib. We need to pass the period for the short-term moving average and the period for the long-term moving average as arguments to this function. We can use the following code to calculate the short-term and long-term moving averages:
    
    ```
    short_ma = ta.SMA(df['close'], timeperiod=short_period)
    long_ma = ta.SMA(df['close'], timeperiod=long_period)
    ```
    
    This will calculate the short-term and long-term moving averages for the stock data and store them in the `short_ma` and `long_ma` variables, respectively. Next request.
    
    
    AI User (Stock Trader):
    
    Instruction: Create a new DataFrame that combines the historical stock data with the short-term and long-term moving averages.

    AI Assistant (Python Programmer):
    
    Solution: We can create a new DataFrame that combines the historical stock data with the short-term and long-term moving averages using the `concat()` function from pandas. We need to pass the historical stock data, the short-term moving average, and the long-term moving average as arguments to this function. We can use the following code to create the new DataFrame:
    
    ```
    new_df = pd.concat([df, short_ma, long_ma], axis=1)
    new_df.columns = ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume', 'short_ma', 'long_ma']
    ```
    
    This will create a new DataFrame called `new_df` that combines the historical stock data with the short-term and long-term moving averages. The columns of the new DataFrame are named 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume', 'short_ma', and 'long_ma'. Next request.
    
    
    AI User (Stock Trader):
    
    Instruction: Create a new column in the DataFrame that indicates when to buy or sell the stock based on the crossover of the short-term and long-term moving averages.
    Input: None.
    
    
    AI Assistant (Python Programmer):
    
    Solution: We can create a new column in the DataFrame that indicates when to buy or sell the stock based on the crossover of the short-term and long-term moving averages. We can use the following code to create the new column:
    
    ```
    new_df['signal'] = np.where(new_df['short_ma'] > new_df['long_ma'], 1, -1)
    ```
    
    This will create a new column called 'signal' in the DataFrame that indicates when to buy or sell the stock based on the crossover of the short-term and long-term moving averages. If the short-term moving average is greater than the long-term moving average, the signal is 1 (buy), otherwise the signal is -1 (sell). Next request.
    
    
    AI User (Stock Trader):
    
    Instruction: Create a new column in the DataFrame that indicates the profit or loss for each trade based on the buy and sell signals and the defined stop loss and profit target.

    AI Assistant (Python Programmer):
    
    Solution: We can create a new column in the DataFrame that indicates the profit or loss for each trade based on the buy and sell signals and the defined stop loss and profit target. We need to pass the stop loss and profit target as percentages as arguments to this function. We can use the following code to create the new column:
    
    ```
    stop_loss = stop_loss_percent / 100
    profit_target = profit_target_percent / 100
    
    new_df['pnl'] = 0.0
    buy_price = 0.0
    for i in range(1, len(new_df)):
        if new_df['signal'][i] == 1 and new_df['signal'][i-1] == -1:
            buy_price = new_df['close'][i]
        elif new_df['signal'][i] == -1 and new_df['signal'][i-1] == 1:
            sell_price = new_df['close'][i]
            if sell_price <= buy_price * (1 - stop_loss):
                new_df['pnl'][i] = -stop_loss
            elif sell_price >= buy_price * (1 + profit_target):
                new_df['pnl'][i] = profit_target
            else:
                new_df['pnl'][i] = (sell_price - buy_price) / buy_price
    ```
    
    This will create a new column called 'pnl' in the DataFrame that indicates the profit or loss for each trade based on the buy and sell signals and the defined stop loss and profit target. The stop loss and profit target are calculated based on the stop_loss_percent and profit_target_percent variables, respectively. The buy and sell prices are stored in the buy_price and sell_price variables, respectively. If the sell price is less than or equal to the stop loss, the profit or loss is set to -stop_loss. If the sell price is greater than or equal to the profit target, the profit or loss is set to profit_target. Otherwise, the profit or loss is calculated as (sell_price - buy_price) / buy_price. Next request.
    
    
    AI User (Stock Trader):
    
    Instruction: Calculate the total profit or loss for all trades.
    Input: None.
    
    
    AI Assistant (Python Programmer):
    
    Solution: We can calculate the total profit or loss for all trades by summing the values in the 'pnl' column of the DataFrame. We can use the following code to calculate the total profit or loss:
    
    ```
    total_pnl = new_df['pnl'].sum()
    ```
    
    This will calculate the total profit or loss for all trades and store it in the total_pnl variable. Next request.

    Instruction: Visualize the stock data, short-term moving average, and long-term moving average using a line chart.
    Input: None.
    
    
    AI Assistant (Python Programmer):
    
    Solution: We can visualize the stock data, short-term moving average, and long-term moving average using a line chart using the `plot()` function from pandas. We can use the following code to visualize the data:
    
    ```
    plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
    plt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['close'], label='Close')
    plt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['short_ma'], label='Short MA')

    Instruction: Visualize the buy and sell signals using a scatter plot.
    Input: None.
    
    
    AI Assistant (Python Programmer):
    
    Solution: We can visualize the buy and sell signals using a scatter plot using the `scatter()` function from matplotlib. We can use the following code to visualize the signals:
    
    ```
    buy_signals = new_df[new_df['signal'] == 1]
    sell_signals = new_df[new_df['signal'] == -1]
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
    plt.scatter(buy_signals.index, buy_signals['close'], label='Buy', marker='^', color='green')
    plt.scatter(sell_signals.index, sell_signals['close'], label='Sell', marker='v', color='red')
    plt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['close'], label='Close')
    plt.xlabel('Date')
    plt.ylabel('Price')
    plt.title('Buy and Sell Signals')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()
    ```
    
    This will create a scatter plot that visualizes the buy and sell signals. The x-axis represents the date and the y-axis represents the price. The chart also includes a legend that labels each point. Next request.
