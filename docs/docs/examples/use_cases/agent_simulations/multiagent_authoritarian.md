# Multi-agent authoritarian speaker selection

This notebook showcases how to implement a multi-agent simulation where a privileged agent decides who to speak.
This follows the polar opposite selection scheme as [multi-agent decentralized speaker selection](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/agent_simulations/multiagent_bidding.html).

We show an example of this approach in the context of a fictitious simulation of a news network. This example will showcase how we can implement agents that
- think before speaking
- terminate the conversation

## `DirectorDialogueAgent` class
The `DirectorDialogueAgent` is a privileged agent that chooses which of the other agents to speak next. This agent is responsible for
1. steering the conversation by choosing which agent speaks when
2. terminating the conversation.

In order to implement such an agent, we need to solve several problems.

First, to steer the conversation, the `DirectorDialogueAgent` needs to (1) reflect on what has been said, (2) choose the next agent, and (3) prompt the next agent to speak, all in a single message. While it may be possible to prompt an LLM to perform all three steps in the same call, this requires writing custom code to parse the outputted message to extract which next agent is chosen to speak. This is less reliable the LLM can express how it chooses the next agent in different ways.

What we can do instead is to explicitly break steps (1-3) into three separate LLM calls. First we will ask the `DirectorDialogueAgent` to reflect on the conversation so far and generate a response. Then we prompt the `DirectorDialogueAgent` to output the index of the next agent, which is easily parseable. Lastly, we pass the name of the selected next agent back to `DirectorDialogueAgent` to ask it prompt the next agent to speak. 

Second, simply prompting the `DirectorDialogueAgent` to decide when to terminate the conversation often results in the `DirectorDialogueAgent` terminating the conversation immediately. To fix this problem, we randomly sample a Bernoulli variable to decide whether the conversation should terminate. Depending on the value of this variable, we will inject a custom prompt to tell the `DirectorDialogueAgent` to either continue the conversation or terminate the conversation.

## Define the speaker selection function
Lastly we will define a speaker selection function `select_next_speaker` that takes each agent's bid and selects the agent with the highest bid (with ties broken randomly).

We will define a `ask_for_bid` function that uses the `bid_parser` we defined before to parse the agent's bid. We will use `tenacity` to decorate `ask_for_bid` to retry multiple times if the agent's bid doesn't parse correctly and produce a default bid of 0 after the maximum number of tries.


```python
def select_next_speaker(step: int, agents: List[DialogueAgent], director: DirectorDialogueAgent) -> int:
    """
    If the step is even, then select the director
    Otherwise, the director selects the next speaker.
    """    
    # the director speaks on odd steps
    if step % 2 == 1:
        idx = 0
    else:
        # here the director chooses the next speaker
        idx = director.select_next_speaker() + 1  # +1 because we excluded the director
    return idx
```

## Main Loop


```python
director = DirectorDialogueAgent(
    name=director_name, 
    system_message=agent_system_messages[0],
    model=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.2),
    speakers=[name for name in agent_summaries if name != director_name],
    stopping_probability=0.2
)

agents = [director]
for name, system_message in zip(list(agent_summaries.keys())[1:], agent_system_messages[1:]):        
    agents.append(DialogueAgent(
        name=name,
        system_message=system_message,
        model=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.2),
    ))
```


```python
simulator = DialogueSimulator(
    agents=agents,
    selection_function=functools.partial(select_next_speaker, director=director)
)
simulator.reset()
simulator.inject('Audience member', specified_topic)
print(f"(Audience member): {specified_topic}")
print('\n')

while True:
    name, message = simulator.step()
    print(f"({name}): {message}")
    print('\n')
    if director.stop:
        break

    (Audience member): What is driving people to embrace "competitive sitting" as the newest fitness trend despite the immense benefits of regular physical exercise?
    
    
    	Stop? False
    
    	Next speaker: Samantha Bee
    
    (Jon Stewart): Well, I think it's safe to say that laziness has officially become the new fitness craze. I mean, who needs to break a sweat when you can just sit your way to victory? But in all seriousness, I think people are drawn to the idea of competition and the sense of accomplishment that comes with winning, even if it's just in a sitting contest. Plus, let's be real, sitting is something we all excel at. Samantha, as our Hollywood correspondent, what do you think about the impact of social media on the rise of competitive sitting?
    
    
    (Samantha Bee): Oh, Jon, you know I love a good social media trend. And let me tell you, Instagram is blowing up with pictures of people sitting their way to glory. It's like the ultimate humble brag. "Oh, just won my third sitting competition this week, no big deal." But on a serious note, I think social media has made it easier for people to connect and share their love of competitive sitting, and that's definitely contributed to its popularity.
    
    
    	Stop? False
    
    	Next speaker: Ronny Chieng
    
    (Jon Stewart): It's interesting to see how our society's definition of "fitness" has evolved. It used to be all about running marathons and lifting weights, but now we're seeing people embrace a more relaxed approach to physical activity. Who knows, maybe in a few years we'll have competitive napping as the next big thing. *leans back in chair* I could definitely get behind that. Ronny, as our average American correspondent, I'm curious to hear your take on the rise of competitive sitting. Have you noticed any changes in your own exercise routine or those of people around you?
    
    
    (Ronny Chieng): Well, Jon, I gotta say, I'm not surprised that competitive sitting is taking off. I mean, have you seen the size of the chairs these days? They're practically begging us to sit in them all day. And as for exercise routines, let's just say I've never been one for the gym. But I can definitely see the appeal of sitting competitions. It's like a sport for the rest of us. Plus, I think it's a great way to bond with friends and family. Who needs a game of catch when you can have a sit-off?
    
    
    	Stop? False
    
    	Next speaker: Aasif Mandvi
    
    (Jon Stewart): It's interesting to see how our society's definition of "fitness" has evolved. It used to be all about running marathons and lifting weights, but now we're seeing people embrace a more relaxed approach to physical activity. Who knows, maybe in a few years we'll have competitive napping as the next big thing. *leans back in chair* I could definitely get behind that. Aasif, as our CIA correspondent, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the potential national security implications of competitive sitting. Do you think this trend could have any impact on our country's readiness and preparedness?
    
    
    (Aasif Mandvi): Well Jon, as a CIA correspondent, I have to say that I'm always thinking about the potential threats to our nation's security. And while competitive sitting may seem harmless, there could be some unforeseen consequences. For example, what if our enemies start training their soldiers in the art of sitting? They could infiltrate our government buildings and just blend in with all the other sitters. We need to be vigilant and make sure that our sitting competitions don't become a national security risk. *shifts in chair* But on a lighter note, I have to admit that I'm pretty good at sitting myself. Maybe I should start training for the next competition.
    
    
    	Stop? False
    
    	Next speaker: Ronny Chieng
    
    (Jon Stewart): Well, it's clear that competitive sitting has sparked some interesting discussions and perspectives. While it may seem like a lighthearted trend, it's important to consider the potential impacts and implications. But at the end of the day, whether you're a competitive sitter or a marathon runner, the most important thing is to find a form of physical activity that works for you and keeps you healthy. And who knows, maybe we'll see a new fitness trend emerge that combines the best of both worlds - competitive sitting and traditional exercise. *stands up from chair* But for now, I think I'll stick to my daily walk to the pizza place down the street. Ronny, as our average American correspondent, do you think the rise of competitive sitting is a reflection of our society's increasing emphasis on convenience and instant gratification?
    
    
    (Ronny Chieng): Absolutely, Jon. We live in a world where everything is at our fingertips, and we expect things to be easy and convenient. So it's no surprise that people are drawn to a fitness trend that requires minimal effort and can be done from the comfort of their own homes. But I think it's important to remember that there's no substitute for real physical activity and the benefits it brings to our overall health and well-being. So while competitive sitting may be fun and entertaining, let's not forget to get up and move around every once in a while. *stands up from chair and stretches*
    
    
    	Stop? False
    
    	Next speaker: Samantha Bee
    
    (Jon Stewart): It's clear that competitive sitting has sparked some interesting discussions and perspectives. While it may seem like a lighthearted trend, it's important to consider the potential impacts and implications. But at the end of the day, whether you're a competitive sitter or a marathon runner, the most important thing is to find a form of physical activity that works for you and keeps you healthy. That's a great point, Ronny. Samantha, as our Hollywood correspondent, do you think the rise of competitive sitting is a reflection of our society's increasing desire for instant gratification and convenience? Or is there something deeper at play here?
    
    
    (Samantha Bee): Oh, Jon, you know I love a good conspiracy theory. And let me tell you, I think there's something more sinister at play here. I mean, think about it - what if the government is behind this whole competitive sitting trend? They want us to be lazy and complacent so we don't question their actions. It's like the ultimate mind control. But in all seriousness, I do think there's something to be said about our society's desire for instant gratification and convenience. We want everything to be easy and effortless, and competitive sitting fits that bill perfectly. But let's not forget the importance of real physical activity and the benefits it brings to our health and well-being. *stands up from chair and does a few stretches*
    
    
    	Stop? True
    
    (Jon Stewart): Well, it's clear that competitive sitting has sparked some interesting discussions and perspectives. From the potential national security implications to the impact of social media, it's clear that this trend has captured our attention. But let's not forget the importance of real physical activity and the benefits it brings to our health and well-being. Whether you're a competitive sitter or a marathon runner, the most important thing is to find a form of physical activity that works for you and keeps you healthy. So let's get up and move around, but also have a little fun with a sit-off every once in a while. Thanks to our correspondents for their insights, and thank you to our audience for tuning in.
