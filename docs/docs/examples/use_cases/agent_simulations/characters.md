# Generative Agents in LangChain

This notebook implements a generative agent based on the paper [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442) by Park, et. al.

In it, we leverage a time-weighted Memory object backed by a LangChain Retriever.

```

### Generative Agent Memory Components

This tutorial highlights the memory of generative agents and its impact on their behavior. The memory varies from standard LangChain Chat memory in two aspects:

1. **Memory Formation**

   Generative Agents have extended memories, stored in a single stream:
      1. Observations - from dialogues or interactions with the virtual world, about self or others
      2. Reflections - resurfaced and summarized core memories


2. **Memory Recall**

   Memories are retrieved using a weighted sum of salience, recency, and importance.

You can review the definitions of the `GenerativeAgent` and `GenerativeAgentMemory` in the [reference documentation]("../../reference/modules/experimental") for the following imports, focusing on `add_memory` and `summarize_related_memories` methods.


```python
from langchain.experimental.generative_agents import GenerativeAgent, GenerativeAgentMemory
```

## Memory Lifecycle

Summarizing the key methods in the above: `add_memory` and `summarize_related_memories`.

When an agent makes an observation, it stores the memory:
    
1. Language model scores the memory's importance (1 for mundane, 10 for poignant)
2. Observation and importance are stored within a document by TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever, with a `last_accessed_time`.

When an agent responds to an observation:

1. Generates query(s) for retriever, which fetches documents based on salience, recency, and importance.
2. Summarizes the retrieved information
3. Updates the `last_accessed_time` for the used documents.


## Create a Generative Character



Now that we've walked through the definition, we will create two characters named "Tommie" and "Eve".


```python
import math
import faiss

def relevance_score_fn(score: float) -> float:
    """Return a similarity score on a scale [0, 1]."""
    # This will differ depending on a few things:
    # - the distance / similarity metric used by the VectorStore
    # - the scale of your embeddings (OpenAI's are unit norm. Many others are not!)
    # This function converts the euclidean norm of normalized embeddings
    # (0 is most similar, sqrt(2) most dissimilar)
    # to a similarity function (0 to 1)
    return 1.0 - score / math.sqrt(2)

def create_new_memory_retriever():
    """Create a new vector store retriever unique to the agent."""
    # Define your embedding model
    embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings()
    # Initialize the vectorstore as empty
    embedding_size = 1536
    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_size)
    vectorstore = FAISS(embeddings_model.embed_query, index, InMemoryDocstore({}), {}, relevance_score_fn=relevance_score_fn)
    return TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=vectorstore, other_score_keys=["importance"], k=15)
```


```python
tommies_memory = GenerativeAgentMemory(
    llm=LLM,
    memory_retriever=create_new_memory_retriever(),
    verbose=False,
    reflection_threshold=8 # we will give this a relatively low number to show how reflection works
)

tommie = GenerativeAgent(name="Tommie", 
              age=25,
              traits="anxious, likes design, talkative", # You can add more persistent traits here 
              status="looking for a job", # When connected to a virtual world, we can have the characters update their status
              memory_retriever=create_new_memory_retriever(),
              llm=LLM,
              memory=tommies_memory
             )
```


```python
# The current "Summary" of a character can't be made because the agent hasn't made
# any observations yet.
print(tommie.get_summary())
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Name: Tommie (age: 25)
    Innate traits: anxious, likes design, talkative
    No information about Tommie's core characteristics is provided in the given statements.
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
# We can add memories directly to the memory object
tommie_observations = [
    "Tommie remembers his dog, Bruno, from when he was a kid",
    "Tommie feels tired from driving so far",
    "Tommie sees the new home",
    "The new neighbors have a cat",
    "The road is noisy at night",
    "Tommie is hungry",
    "Tommie tries to get some rest.",
]
for observation in tommie_observations:
    tommie.memory.add_memory(observation)
```


```python
# Now that Tommie has 'memories', their self-summary is more descriptive, though still rudimentary.
# We will see how this summary updates after more observations to create a more rich description.
print(tommie.get_summary(force_refresh=True))
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Name: Tommie (age: 25)
    Innate traits: anxious, likes design, talkative
    Tommie is a person who is observant of his surroundings, has a sentimental side, and experiences basic human needs such as hunger and the need for rest. He also tends to get tired easily and is affected by external factors such as noise from the road or a neighbor's pet.

## Pre-Interview with Character

Before sending our character on their way, let's ask them a few questions.


```python
def interview_agent(agent: GenerativeAgent, message: str) -> str:
    """Help the notebook user interact with the agent."""
    new_message = f"{USER_NAME} says {message}"
    return agent.generate_dialogue_response(new_message)[1]
```


```python
interview_agent(tommie, "What do you like to do?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    'Tommie said "I really enjoy design and being creative. I\'ve been working on some personal projects lately. What about you, Person A? What do you like to do?"'
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
interview_agent(tommie, "What are you looking forward to doing today?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    'Tommie said "Well, I\'m actually looking for a job right now, so hopefully I can find some job postings online and start applying. How about you, Person A? What\'s on your schedule for today?"'
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
interview_agent(tommie, "What are you most worried about today?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    'Tommie said "Honestly, I\'m feeling pretty anxious about finding a job. It\'s been a bit of a struggle lately, but I\'m trying to stay positive and keep searching. How about you, Person A? What worries you?"'
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## Step through the day's observations.


```python
# Let's have Tommie start going through a day in the life.

## Adding Multiple Characters

Let's add a second character to have a conversation with Tommie. Feel free to configure different traits.


```python
eves_memory = GenerativeAgentMemory(
    llm=LLM,
    memory_retriever=create_new_memory_retriever(),
    verbose=False,
    reflection_threshold=5
)


eve = GenerativeAgent(name="Eve", 
              age=34, 
              traits="curious, helpful", # You can add more persistent traits here 
              status="N/A", # When connected to a virtual world, we can have the characters update their status
              llm=LLM,
              daily_summaries = [
                  ("Eve started her new job as a career counselor last week and received her first assignment, a client named Tommie.")
              ],
              memory=eves_memory,
              verbose=False
             )
```


```python
yesterday = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)).strftime("%A %B %d")
eve_observations = [
    "Eve wakes up and hear's the alarm",
    "Eve eats a boal of porridge",
    "Eve helps a coworker on a task",
    "Eve plays tennis with her friend Xu before going to work",
    "Eve overhears her colleague say something about Tommie being hard to work with",
]
for observation in eve_observations:
    eve.memory.add_memory(observation)
```


```python
print(eve.get_summary())
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Name: Eve (age: 34)
    Innate traits: curious, helpful
    Eve is a helpful and active person who enjoys sports and takes care of her physical health. She is attentive to her surroundings, including her colleagues, and has good time management skills.
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## Pre-conversation interviews


Let's "Interview" Eve before she speaks with Tommie.


```python
interview_agent(eve, "How are you feeling about today?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    'Eve said "I\'m feeling pretty good, thanks for asking! Just trying to stay productive and make the most of the day. How about you?"'
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
interview_agent(eve, "What do you know about Tommie?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    'Eve said "I don\'t know much about Tommie, but I heard someone mention that they find them difficult to work with. Have you had any experiences working with Tommie?"'
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
interview_agent(eve, "Tommie is looking to find a job. What are are some things you'd like to ask him?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    'Eve said "That\'s interesting. I don\'t know much about Tommie\'s work experience, but I would probably ask about his strengths and areas for improvement. What about you?"'
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
interview_agent(eve, "You'll have to ask him. He may be a bit anxious, so I'd appreciate it if you keep the conversation going and ask as many questions as possible.")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    'Eve said "Sure, I can keep the conversation going and ask plenty of questions. I want to make sure Tommie feels comfortable and supported. Thanks for letting me know."'
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## Dialogue between Generative Agents

Generative agents are much more complex when they interact with a virtual environment or with each other. Below, we run a simple conversation between Tommie and Eve.


```python
def run_conversation(agents: List[GenerativeAgent], initial_observation: str) -> None:
    """Runs a conversation between agents."""
    _, observation = agents[1].generate_reaction(initial_observation)
    print(observation)
    turns = 0
    while True:
        break_dialogue = False
        for agent in agents:
            stay_in_dialogue, observation = agent.generate_dialogue_response(observation)
            print(observation)
            # observation = f"{agent.name} said {reaction}"
            if not stay_in_dialogue:
                break_dialogue = True   
        if break_dialogue:
            break
        turns += 1
```


```python
agents = [tommie, eve]
run_conversation(agents, "Tommie said: Hi, Eve. Thanks for agreeing to meet with me today. I have a bunch of questions and am not sure where to start. Maybe you could first share about your experience?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Eve said "Sure, Tommie. I'd be happy to share about my experience. Where would you like me to start?"
    Tommie said "That's great, thank you! How about you start by telling me about your previous work experience?"
    Eve said "Sure, I'd be happy to share my previous work experience with you. I've worked in a few different industries, including marketing and event planning. What specific questions do you have for me?"
    Tommie said "That's great to hear. Can you tell me more about your experience in event planning? I've always been interested in that field."
    Eve said "Sure, I'd be happy to share about my experience in event planning. I've worked on a variety of events, from corporate conferences to weddings. One of the biggest challenges I faced was managing multiple vendors and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day of the event. What specific questions do you have?"
    Tommie said "That sounds like a lot of responsibility! Can you tell me more about how you handled the challenges that came up during those events?"
    Eve said "Sure, Tommie. I'd be happy to share with you how I handled those challenges. One approach that worked well for me was to stay organized and create a detailed timeline for the event. This helped me keep track of all the different tasks that needed to be done and when they needed to be completed. I also made sure to communicate clearly with all the vendors and team members involved in the event to ensure everyone was on the same page. Would you like me to go into more detail?"
    Tommie said "Thank you for sharing that with me, Eve. That sounds like a great approach to managing events. Can you tell me more about how you handled any unexpected issues that came up during the events?"
    Eve said "Of course, Tommie. One example of an unexpected issue I faced was when one of the vendors didn't show up on time. To handle this, I quickly contacted a backup vendor and was able to get everything back on track. It's always important to have a backup plan in case things don't go as planned. Do you have any other questions about event planning?"
    Tommie said "Thank you for sharing that with me, Eve. It's really helpful to hear how you handled unexpected issues like that. Can you give me an example of how you communicated with your team to ensure everyone was on the same page during an event?"
    Eve said "Sure, Tommie. One thing I did to ensure everyone was on the same page was to have regular check-ins and meetings with the team leading up to the event. This helped us address any issues or concerns early on and make sure everyone was clear on their roles and responsibilities. Have you ever had to manage a team for an event before?"
    Tommie said "That's a great idea, Eve. I haven't had the opportunity to manage a team for an event yet, but I'll definitely keep that in mind for the future. Thank you for sharing your experience with me."
    Eve said "Thanks for the opportunity to share my experience, Tommie. It was great meeting with you today."
```

## Let's interview our agents after their conversation

Since the generative agents retain their memories from the day, we can ask them about their plans, conversations, and other memoreis.


```python
# We can see a current "Summary" of a character based on their own perception of self
# has changed
print(tommie.get_summary(force_refresh=True))
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```

    Innate traits: anxious, likes design, talkative
    Tommie is determined and hopeful in his job search, but can also feel discouraged and frustrated at times. He has a strong connection to his childhood dog, Bruno. Tommie seeks support from his friends when feeling overwhelmed and is grateful for their help. He also enjoys exploring his new city.
