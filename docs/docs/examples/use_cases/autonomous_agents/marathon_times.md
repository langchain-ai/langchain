## AutoGPT example finding Winning Marathon Times

* Implementation of https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT 
* With LangChain primitives (LLMs, PromptTemplates, VectorStores, Embeddings, Tools)

```


```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", temperature=1.0)
```

### Set up tools

* We'll set up an AutoGPT with a `search` tool, and `write-file` tool, and a `read-file` tool, a web browsing tool, and a tool to interact with a CSV file via a python REPL

Define any other `tools` you want to use below:


```python
# Tools
import os
from contextlib import contextmanager
from typing import Optional
from langchain.agents import tool
from langchain.tools.file_management.read import ReadFileTool
from langchain.tools.file_management.write import WriteFileTool

ROOT_DIR = "./data/"

@contextmanager
def pushd(new_dir):
    """Context manager for changing the current working directory."""
    prev_dir = os.getcwd()
    os.chdir(new_dir)
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        os.chdir(prev_dir)

@tool
def process_csv(
    csv_file_path: str, instructions: str, output_path: Optional[str] = None
) -> str:
    """Process a CSV by with pandas in a limited REPL.\
 Only use this after writing data to disk as a csv file.\
 Any figures must be saved to disk to be viewed by the human.\
 Instructions should be written in natural language, not code. Assume the dataframe is already loaded."""
    with pushd(ROOT_DIR):
        try:
            df = pd.read_csv(csv_file_path)
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error: {e}"
        agent = create_pandas_dataframe_agent(llm, df, max_iterations=30, verbose=True)
        if output_path is not None:
            instructions += f" Save output to disk at {output_path}"
        try:
            result = agent.run(instructions)
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error: {e}"
```

**Browse a web page with PlayWright**


```python
# !pip install playwright
# !playwright install
```


```python
async def async_load_playwright(url: str) -> str:
    """Load the specified URLs using Playwright and parse using BeautifulSoup."""
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

    results = ""
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
        try:
            page = await browser.new_page()
            await page.goto(url)

            page_source = await page.content()
            soup = BeautifulSoup(page_source, "html.parser")

            for script in soup(["script", "style"]):
                script.extract()

            text = soup.get_text()
            lines = (line.strip() for line in text.splitlines())
            chunks = (phrase.strip() for line in lines for phrase in line.split("  "))
            results = "\n".join(chunk for chunk in chunks if chunk)
        except Exception as e:
            results = f"Error: {e}"
        await browser.close()
    return results

def run_async(coro):
    event_loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    return event_loop.run_until_complete(coro)

@tool
def browse_web_page(url: str) -> str:
    """Verbose way to scrape a whole webpage. Likely to cause issues parsing."""
    return run_async(async_load_playwright(url))
```

**Q&A Over a webpage**

Help the model ask more directed questions of web pages to avoid cluttering its memory


```python
from langchain.tools import BaseTool, DuckDuckGoSearchRun
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

from pydantic import Field
from langchain.chains.qa_with_sources.loading import load_qa_with_sources_chain, BaseCombineDocumentsChain

def _get_text_splitter():
    return RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
        # Set a really small chunk size, just to show.
        chunk_size = 500,
        chunk_overlap  = 20,
        length_function = len,
    )


class WebpageQATool(BaseTool):
    name = "query_webpage"
    description = "Browse a webpage and retrieve the information relevant to the question."
    text_splitter: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter = Field(default_factory=_get_text_splitter)
    qa_chain: BaseCombineDocumentsChain
    
    def _run(self, url: str, question: str) -> str:
        """Useful for browsing websites and scraping the text information."""
        result = browse_web_page.run(url)
        docs = [Document(page_content=result, metadata={"source": url})]
        web_docs = self.text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
        results = []
        # TODO: Handle this with a MapReduceChain
        for i in range(0, len(web_docs), 4):
            input_docs = web_docs[i:i+4]
            window_result = self.qa_chain({"input_documents": input_docs, "question": question}, return_only_outputs=True)
            results.append(f"Response from window {i} - {window_result}")
        results_docs = [Document(page_content="\n".join(results), metadata={"source": url})]
        return self.qa_chain({"input_documents": results_docs, "question": question}, return_only_outputs=True)
    
    async def _arun(self, url: str, question: str) -> str:
        raise NotImplementedError
```


```python
query_website_tool = WebpageQATool(qa_chain=load_qa_with_sources_chain(llm))
```

### Set up memory

* The memory here is used for the agents intermediate steps


```python
# Memory
import faiss
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.docstore import InMemoryDocstore
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.tools.human.tool import HumanInputRun

embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings()
embedding_size = 1536
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_size)
vectorstore = FAISS(embeddings_model.embed_query, index, InMemoryDocstore({}), {})
```

### Setup model and AutoGPT

`Model set-up`


```python
# !pip install duckduckgo_search
web_search = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()
```


```python
tools = [
    web_search,
    WriteFileTool(root_dir="./data"),
    ReadFileTool(root_dir="./data"),
    process_csv,
    query_website_tool,
    # HumanInputRun(), # Activate if you want the permit asking for help from the human
]
```


```python
agent = AutoGPT.from_llm_and_tools(
    ai_name="Tom",
    ai_role="Assistant",
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    memory=vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 8}),
    # human_in_the_loop=True, # Set to True if you want to add feedback at each step.
)
# agent.chain.verbose = True
```

### AutoGPT for Querying the Web
 
  
I've spent a lot of time over the years crawling data sources and cleaning data. Let's see if AutoGPT can help with this!

Here is the prompt for looking up recent boston marathon times and converting them to tabular form.


```python
agent.run(["What were the winning boston marathon times for the past 5 years (ending in 2022)? Generate a table of the year, name, country of origin, and times."])
```

    Thought: The CSV file has already been read and saved into a pandas dataframe called `df`. Hence, I can simply display the data by printing the whole dataframe. Since `df.head()` returns the first 5 rows, I can use that to showcase the contents.

    Thought:I used the wrong tool to perform the action. I should have used the given data and not interacted with the Python shell. I can now provide the displayed data as the answer since the information in the printed dataframe would look like a table when typed as text.
