# BabyAGI User Guide

This notebook demonstrates how to implement [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi/tree/main) by [Yohei Nakajima](https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima). BabyAGI is an AI agent that can generate and pretend to execute tasks based on a given objective.

This guide will help you understand the components to create your own recursive agents.

Although BabyAGI uses specific vectorstores/model providers (Pinecone, OpenAI), one of the benefits of implementing it with LangChain is that you can easily swap those out for different options. In this implementation we use a FAISS vectorstore (because it runs locally and is free).

## Install and Import Required Modules


```python
import os
from collections import deque
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any

from langchain import LLMChain, OpenAI, PromptTemplate
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.llms import BaseLLM
from langchain.vectorstores.base import VectorStore
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from langchain.chains.base import Chain
from langchain.experimental import BabyAGI
```

## Connect to the Vector Store

Depending on what vectorstore you use, this step may look different.


```python
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.docstore import InMemoryDocstore
```


```python
# Define your embedding model
embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings()
# Initialize the vectorstore as empty
import faiss

embedding_size = 1536
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_size)
vectorstore = FAISS(embeddings_model.embed_query, index, InMemoryDocstore({}), {})
```

### Run the BabyAGI

Now it's time to create the BabyAGI controller and watch it try to accomplish your objective.


```python
OBJECTIVE = "Write a weather report for SF today"
```


```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
```


```python
# Logging of LLMChains
verbose = False
# If None, will keep on going forever
max_iterations: Optional[int] = 3
baby_agi = BabyAGI.from_llm(
    llm=llm, vectorstore=vectorstore, verbose=verbose, max_iterations=max_iterations
)
```


```python
baby_agi({"objective": OBJECTIVE})
```

    3: Check the current UV index in San Francisco.
    4: Check the current air quality in San Francisco.
    5: Check the current precipitation levels in San Francisco.
    6: Check the current cloud cover in San Francisco.
    7: Check the current barometric pressure in San Francisco.
    8: Check the current dew point in San Francisco.
    9: Check the current wind direction in San Francisco.
    10: Check the current humidity levels in San Francisco.
