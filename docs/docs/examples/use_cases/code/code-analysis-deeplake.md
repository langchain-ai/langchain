# Use LangChain, GPT and Deep Lake to work with code base
In this tutorial, we are going to use Langchain + Deep Lake with GPT to analyze the code base of the LangChain itself. 

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->

## Design

1. Prepare data:
   1. Upload all python project files using the `langchain.document_loaders.TextLoader`. We will call these files the **documents**.
   2. Split all documents to chunks using the `langchain.text_splitter.CharacterTextSplitter`.
   3. Embed chunks and upload them into the DeepLake using `langchain.embeddings.openai.OpenAIEmbeddings` and `langchain.vectorstores.DeepLake`
2. Question-Answering:
   1. Build a chain from `langchain.chat_models.ChatOpenAI` and `langchain.chains.ConversationalRetrievalChain`
   2. Prepare questions.
   3. Get answers running the chain.


## Implementation

### Integration preparations

We need to set up keys for external services and install necessary python libraries.


```python
#!python3 -m pip install --upgrade langchain deeplake openai
```

Set up OpenAI embeddings, Deep Lake multi-modal vector store api and authenticate. 

For full documentation of Deep Lake please follow https://docs.activeloop.ai/ and API reference https://docs.deeplake.ai/en/latest/


```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = getpass()
# Please manually enter OpenAI Key
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
     ········
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

Authenticate into Deep Lake if you want to create your own dataset and publish it. You can get an API key from the platform at [app.activeloop.ai](https://app.activeloop.ai)


```python
os.environ['ACTIVELOOP_TOKEN'] = getpass.getpass('Activeloop Token:')
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
     ········
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

### Prepare data 

Load all repository files. Here we assume this notebook is downloaded as the part of the langchain fork and we work with the python files of the `langchain` repo.

If you want to use files from different repo, change `root_dir` to the root dir of your repo.

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader

root_dir = '../../../../..'

docs = []
for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(root_dir):
    for file in filenames:
        if file.endswith('.py') and '/.venv/' not in dirpath:
            try:
                loader = TextLoader(os.path.join(dirpath, file), encoding='utf-8')
                docs.extend(loader.load_and_split())
            except Exception as e:
                pass
print(f'{len(docs)}')
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    1147
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

Then, chunk the files


```python
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
print(f"{len(texts)}")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

Then embed chunks and upload them to the DeepLake.

This can take several minutes. 


```python
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
embeddings
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    OpenAIEmbeddings(client=<class 'openai.api_resources.embedding.Embedding'>, model='text-embedding-ada-002', document_model_name='text-embedding-ada-002', query_model_name='text-embedding-ada-002', embedding_ctx_length=8191, openai_api_key=None, openai_organization=None, allowed_special=set(), disallowed_special='all', chunk_size=1000, max_retries=6)
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
from langchain.vectorstores import DeepLake

db = DeepLake.from_documents(texts, embeddings, dataset_path=f"hub://{DEEPLAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME}/langchain-code")
db
```

### Question Answering
First load the dataset, construct the retriever, then construct the Conversational Chain


```python
db = DeepLake(dataset_path=f"hub://{DEEPLAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME}/langchain-code", read_only=True, embedding_function=embeddings)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

    This dataset can be visualized in Jupyter Notebook by ds.visualize() or at https://app.activeloop.ai/user_name/langchain-code

retriever.search_kwargs['fetch_k'] = 20

```

You can also specify user defined functions using [Deep Lake filters](https://docs.deeplake.ai/en/latest/deeplake.core.dataset.html#deeplake.core.dataset.Dataset.filter)


```python
def filter(x):
    # filter based on source code
    if 'something' in x['text'].data()['value']:
        return False
    
    # filter based on path e.g. extension
    metadata =  x['metadata'].data()['value']
    return 'only_this' in metadata['source'] or 'also_that' in metadata['source']

### turn on below for custom filtering
# retriever.search_kwargs['filter'] = filter
```


```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain

model = ChatOpenAI(model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo') # 'ada' 'gpt-3.5-turbo' 'gpt-4',
qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(model,retriever=retriever)
```


```python
questions = [
    "What is the class hierarchy?",
    # "What classes are derived from the Chain class?",
    # "What classes and functions in the ./langchain/utilities/ forlder are not covered by unit tests?",
    # "What one improvement do you propose in code in relation to the class herarchy for the Chain class?",
] 
chat_history = []

for question in questions:  
    result = qa({"question": question, "chat_history": chat_history})
    chat_history.append((question, result['answer']))
    print(f"-> **Question**: {question} \n")
    print(f"**Answer**: {result['answer']} \n")
```

-> **Question**: What is the class hierarchy? 

**Answer**: There are several class hierarchies in the provided code, so I'll list a few:

1. `BaseModel` -> `ConstitutionalPrinciple`: `ConstitutionalPrinciple` is a subclass of `BaseModel`.
2. `BasePromptTemplate` -> `StringPromptTemplate`, `AIMessagePromptTemplate`, `BaseChatPromptTemplate`, `ChatMessagePromptTemplate`, `ChatPromptTemplate`, `HumanMessagePromptTemplate`, `MessagesPlaceholder`, `SystemMessagePromptTemplate`, `FewShotPromptTemplate`, `FewShotPromptWithTemplates`, `Prompt`, `PromptTemplate`: All of these classes are subclasses of `BasePromptTemplate`.
3. `APIChain`, `Chain`, `MapReduceDocumentsChain`, `MapRerankDocumentsChain`, `RefineDocumentsChain`, `StuffDocumentsChain`, `HypotheticalDocumentEmbedder`, `LLMChain`, `LLMBashChain`, `LLMCheckerChain`, `LLMMathChain`, `LLMRequestsChain`, `PALChain`, `QAWithSourcesChain`, `VectorDBQAWithSourcesChain`, `VectorDBQA`, `SQLDatabaseChain`: All of these classes are subclasses of `Chain`.
4. `BaseLoader`: `BaseLoader` is a subclass of `ABC`.
5. `BaseTracer` -> `ChainRun`, `LLMRun`, `SharedTracer`, `ToolRun`, `Tracer`, `TracerException`, `TracerSession`: All of these classes are subclasses of `BaseTracer`.
6. `OpenAIEmbeddings`, `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`, `CohereEmbeddings`, `JinaEmbeddings`, `LlamaCppEmbeddings`, `HuggingFaceHubEmbeddings`, `TensorflowHubEmbeddings`, `SagemakerEndpointEmbeddings`, `HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings`, `SelfHostedEmbeddings`, `SelfHostedHuggingFaceEmbeddings`, `SelfHostedHuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings`, `FakeEmbeddings`, `AlephAlphaAsymmetricSemanticEmbedding`, `AlephAlphaSymmetricSemanticEmbedding`: All of these classes are subclasses of `BaseLLM`. 


-> **Question**: What classes are derived from the Chain class? 

**Answer**: There are multiple classes that are derived from the Chain class. Some of them are:
- APIChain
- AnalyzeDocumentChain
- ChatVectorDBChain
- CombineDocumentsChain
- ConstitutionalChain
- ConversationChain
- GraphQAChain
- HypotheticalDocumentEmbedder
- LLMChain
- LLMCheckerChain
- LLMRequestsChain
- LLMSummarizationCheckerChain
- MapReduceChain
- OpenAPIEndpointChain
- PALChain
- QAWithSourcesChain
- RetrievalQA
- RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain
- SequentialChain
- SQLDatabaseChain
- TransformChain
- VectorDBQA
- VectorDBQAWithSourcesChain

There might be more classes that are derived from the Chain class as it is possible to create custom classes that extend the Chain class.


-> **Question**: What classes and functions in the ./langchain/utilities/ forlder are not covered by unit tests? 

**Answer**: All classes and functions in the `./langchain/utilities/` folder seem to have unit tests written for them.
