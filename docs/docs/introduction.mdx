# Introduction

**LangChain** is a software framework that helps you build more reliable large language model (LLM) applications, faster.

LangChain open-source libraries and commercial products simplify every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:
- **Develop**: Quickly build applications that are highly modular and easy to iterate on with `langchain`'s
[standard interfaces](/docs/concepts/#langchain-expression-language-lcel) for the most popular [models](/docs/concepts/#chat-models), [vector stores](/docs/concepts/#vector-stores), and [much more](/docs/concepts/#components).
Create stateful, agentic workflows with first-class support for event streaming and human-in-the-loop architectures using [`langgraph`](/docs/concepts/#langgraph).
- **Productionize**: Continuously deploy with confidence using [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/), a developer platform for inspecting, monitoring, evaluating, and optimizing LLM applications.
- **Deploy**: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready Assistant APIs with [LangGraph Cloud](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/).

Concretely, the framework consists of the following open-source libraries:

- **`langchain-core`**: [Component abstractions](/docs/concepts/#components) and [LangChain Expression Language](/docs/concepts/#langchain-expression-language-lcel).
- Integration packages (`langchain-openai`, `langchain-anthropic`, `langchain-community`, etc.): Standard interfaces for all the most popular third-party integrations.
- **`langchain`**: Prebuilt chains, agents, and retrieval strategies for common cognitive architectures.
- **[`langgraph`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph)**: Protocol for building robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph. Integrates seamlessly with `langchain` and LangSmith, but can be used without them as well.
- **[`langserve`](/docs/langserve)**: Library for serving `langchain` chains as REST APIs.

And the following commercial products:
- **[LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com)**: A developer platform that lets you debug, evaluate, monitor, and optimize LLM applications, whether or not they're built with LangChain libraries.
- **[LangGraph Cloud](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/): Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready Assistant APIs.

## [How-to guides](/docs/how_to)

[Here](/docs/how_to) you’ll find short answers to “How do I…?” types of questions.
These how-to guides don’t cover topics in depth – you’ll find that material in the [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials) and the [API Reference](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/).
However, these guides will help you quickly accomplish common tasks.

## [Conceptual guide](/docs/concepts)

Introductions to all the key parts of LangChain you’ll need to know! [Here](/docs/concepts) you'll find high level explanations of all LangChain concepts.
