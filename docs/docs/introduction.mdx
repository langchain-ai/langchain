# Introduction

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:
- **Development**: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source [building blocks](/docs/concepts#langchain-expression-language-lcel), [components](/docs/concepts), and [third-party integrations](/docs/integrations/platforms/).
Use [LangGraph](/docs/concepts/#langgraph) to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.
- **Productionization**: Use [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) to inspect, monitor and evaluate your chains, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.
- **Deployment**: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with [LangGraph Cloud](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/).

Concretely, the framework consists of the following open-source libraries:

- **`langchain-core`**: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.
- **`langchain-community`**: Third party integrations.
  - Partner packages (e.g. **`langchain-openai`**, **`langchain-anthropic`**, etc.): Some integrations have been further split into their own lightweight packages that only depend on **`langchain-core`**.
- **`langchain`**: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
- **[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph)**: Build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph. Integrates smoothly with LangChain, but can be used without it.
- **[LangServe](/docs/langserve)**: Deploy LangChain chains as REST APIs.
- **[LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com)**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor LLM applications.

## [How-to guides](/docs/how_to)

[Here](/docs/how_to) you’ll find short answers to “How do I….?” types of questions.
These how-to guides don’t cover topics in depth – you’ll find that material in the [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials) and the [API Reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/).
However, these guides will help you quickly accomplish common tasks.
