    "\n",
    "- Using [language models](/docs/concepts/#chat-models).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using [document loaders](/docs/concepts/#document-loaders), specifically the [WebBaseLoader](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.web_base.WebBaseLoader.html) to load content from an HTML webpage.\n",

    "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A central question for building a summarizer is how to pass your documents into the LLM's context window. Two common approaches for this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Stuff`: Simply \"stuff\" all your documents into a single prompt. This is the simplest approach (see [here](/docs/tutorials/rag#built-in-chains) for more on the `create_stuff_documents_chain` constructor, which is used for this method).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Map-reduce`: Summarize each document on its own in a \"map\" step and then \"reduce\" the summaries into a final summary (see [here](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.combine_documents.map_reduce.MapReduceDocumentsChain.html) for more on the `MapReduceDocumentsChain`, which is used for this method).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that map-reduce is especially effective when understanding of a sub-document does not rely on preceeding context. For example, when summarizing a corpus of many, shorter documents. In other cases, such as summarizing a novel or body of text with an inherent sequence, [iterative refinement](/docs/how_to/summarize_refine) may be more effective."

Techniques like Chain of Hindsight and Algorithm Distillation are discussed to enhance model performance through iterative learning.\\n\\n6. **Structured Software Development**: A systematic approach to creating Python software projects is emphasized, focusing on defining core components, managing dependencies, and adhering to best practices for documentation.\\n\\nOverall, the integration of structured planning, memory systems, and advanced tool use aims to enhance the capabilities of LLM-powered autonomous agents while addressing the challenges and limitations these technologies face in real-world applications.'}}\n"
