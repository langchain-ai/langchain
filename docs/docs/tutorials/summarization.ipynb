    "\n",
    "Concepts we will cover are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using [language models](/docs/concepts/#chat-models).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using [document loaders](/docs/concepts/#document-loaders), specifically the [WebBaseLoader](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.web_base.WebBaseLoader.html) to load content from an HTML webpage.\n",

    "  2. [Map-reduce](/docs/tutorials/summarization#map-reduce), which splits documents into batches, summarizes those, and then summarizes the summaries;\n",
    "  3. [Refine](/docs/tutorials/summarization#refine), which updates a rolling summary be iterating over the documents in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a fair amount to cover! Let's dive in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide (and most of the other guides in the documentation) uses [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and assumes the reader is as well. Jupyter notebooks are perfect for learning how to work with LLM systems because oftentimes things can go wrong (unexpected output, API down, etc) and going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To install LangChain run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{=mdx}\n",
    "import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\n",
    "import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A central question for building a summarizer is how to pass your documents into the LLM's context window. Three common approaches for this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Stuff`: Simply \"stuff\" all your documents into a single prompt. This is the simplest approach (see [here](/docs/tutorials/rag#built-in-chains) for more on the `create_stuff_documents_chain` constructor, which is used for this method).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Map-reduce`: Summarize each document on its own in a \"map\" step and then \"reduce\" the summaries into a final summary (see [here](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.combine_documents.map_reduce.MapReduceDocumentsChain.html) for more on the `MapReduceDocumentsChain`, which is used for this method).\n",

      "The existing summary provides detailed instructions for implementing a project's architecture through code, focusing on creating core classes, functions, and methods in different files following best practices for the chosen language and framework. Assumptions about the model, view, and controller components are also outlined. The additional context highlights challenges in long-term planning and task decomposition, as well as the reliability issues with natural language interfaces in LLM-powered autonomous agents. These insights shed light on the limitations and potential pitfalls of using LLMs in agent systems, with references to recent research on LLM-powered autonomous agents and related technologies.\n"

      "Il presente articolo discute il concetto di costruire agenti autonomi utilizzando LLM (large language model) come controller principale. Esplora i diversi componenti di un sistema di agenti alimentato da LLM, tra cui la pianificazione, la memoria e l'uso degli strumenti. Dimostrazioni di concetto come AutoGPT mostrano il potenziale di LLM come risolutore generale di problemi. Approcci come Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, LLM+P, ReAct e Reflexion consentono agli agenti autonomi di pianificare, riflettere su se stessi e migliorarsi iterativamente. Tuttavia, ci sono sfide da affrontare, come la limitata capacità di contesto che limita l'inclusione di informazioni storiche dettagliate e la difficoltà di pianificazione a lungo termine e decomposizione delle attività. Inoltre, l'affidabilità dell'interfaccia di linguaggio naturale tra LLM e componenti esterni come la memoria e gli strumenti è incerta, poiché i LLM possono commettere errori di formattazione e mostrare comportamenti ribelli. Nonostante ciò, il sistema AutoGPT viene menzionato come esempio di dimostrazione di concetto che utilizza LLM come controller principale per agenti autonomi. Questo articolo fa riferimento a diverse fonti che esplorano approcci e applicazioni specifiche di LLM nell'ambito degli agenti autonomi.\n"
