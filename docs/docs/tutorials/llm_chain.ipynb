    "# Build a Simple LLM Application with LCEL\n",
    "\n",
    "In this quickstart we'll show you how to build a simple LLM application with LangChain. This application will translate text from English into another language. This is a relatively simple LLM application - it's just a single LLM call plus some prompting. Still, this is a great way to get started with LangChain - a lot of features can be built with just some prompting and an LLM call!\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading this tutorial, you'll have a high level overview of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using [language models](/docs/concepts/#chat-models)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using [PromptTemplates](/docs/concepts/#prompt-templates) and [OutputParsers](/docs/concepts/#output-parsers)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/#langchain-expression-language-lcel) to chain components together\n",

    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide (and most of the other guides in the documentation) uses [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and assumes the reader is as well. Jupyter notebooks are perfect for learning how to work with LLM systems because oftentimes things can go wrong (unexpected output, API down, etc) and going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To install LangChain run:\n",
    "\n",
    "import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\n",
    "import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n",
    "import CodeBlock from \"@theme/CodeBlock\";\n",

    "\n",
    "### LangSmith\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
    "As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\n",
    "The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n",
