    "# Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) App\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful applications enabled by LLMs is sophisticated question-answering (Q&A) chatbots. These are applications that can answer questions about specific source information. These applications use a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will show how to build a simple Q&A application\n",
    "over a text data source. Along the way we’ll go over a typical Q&A\n",
    "architecture and highlight additional resources for more advanced Q&A techniques. We’ll also see\n",
    "how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application.\n",
    "LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in\n",
    "complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're already familiar with basic retrieval, you might also be interested in\n",
    "this [high-level overview of different retrieval techinques](/docs/concepts/#retrieval).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model's cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain has a number of components designed to help build Q&A applications, and RAG applications more generally. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Here we focus on Q&A for unstructured data. If you are interested for RAG over structured data, check out our tutorial on doing [question/answering over SQL data](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts\n",
    "A typical RAG application has two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. *This usually happens offline.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing\n",
    "1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. This is done with [Document Loaders](/docs/concepts/#document-loaders).\n",
    "2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/concepts/#text-splitters) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won't fit in a model's finite context window.\n",
    "3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/concepts/#vector-stores) and [Embeddings](/docs/concepts/#embedding-models) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![index_diagram](../../static/img/rag_indexing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval and generation\n",
    "4. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/concepts/#retrievers).\n",
    "5. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/concepts/#chat-models) / [LLM](/docs/concepts/#llms) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data\n",
    "\n",
    "![retrieval_diagram](../../static/img/rag_retrieval_generation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide (and most of the other guides in the documentation) uses [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and assumes the reader is as well. Jupyter notebooks are perfect for learning how to work with LLM systems because oftentimes things can go wrong (unexpected output, API down, etc) and going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial requires these langchain dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{=mdx}\n",
    "import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\n",
    "import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n",
    "import CodeBlock from \"@theme/CodeBlock\";\n",
    "\n",
    "<Tabs>\n",
    "  <TabItem value=\"pip\" label=\"Pip\" default>\n",
    "    <CodeBlock language=\"bash\">pip install langchain langchain_community langchain_chroma</CodeBlock>\n",
    "  </TabItem>\n",
    "  <TabItem value=\"conda\" label=\"Conda\">\n",
    "    <CodeBlock language=\"bash\">conda install langchain langchain_community langchain_chroma -c conda-forge</CodeBlock>\n",
    "  </TabItem>\n",
    "</Tabs>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/how_to/installation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangSmith\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
    "As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\n",
    "The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\"true\"\n",
    "export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\"...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if in a notebook, you can set them with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import getpass\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2\"] = \"true\"\n",
    "os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide we’ll build an app that answers questions about the content of a website. The specific website we will use is the [LLM Powered Autonomous\n",

    "Let's dissect the LCEL to understand what's going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "First: each of these components (`retriever`, `prompt`, `llm`, etc.) are instances of [Runnable](/docs/concepts#langchain-expression-language-lcel). This means that they implement the same methods-- such as sync and async `.invoke`, `.stream`, or `.batch`-- which makes them easier to connect together. They can be connected into a [RunnableSequence](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.base.RunnableSequence.html)-- another Runnable-- via the `|` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain will automatically cast certain objects to runnables when met with the `|` operator. Here, `format_docs` is cast to a [RunnableLambda](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.base.RunnableLambda.html), and the dict with `\"context\"` and `\"question\"` is cast to a [RunnableParallel](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.base.RunnableParallel.html). The details are less important than the bigger point, which is that each object is a Runnable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's trace how the input question flows through the above runnables.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen above, the input to `prompt` is expected to be a dict with keys `\"context\"` and `\"question\"`. So the first element of this chain builds runnables that will calculate both of these from the input question:\n",
    "- `retriever | format_docs` passes the question through the retriever, generating [Document](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/api_reference/core/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html) objects, and then to `format_docs` to generate strings;\n",
    "- `RunnablePassthrough()` passes through the input question unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, if you constructed\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chain = (\n",
    "    {\"context\": retriever | format_docs, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()}\n",
    "    | prompt\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then `chain.invoke(question)` would build a formatted prompt, ready for inference. (Note: when developing with LCEL, it can be practical to test with sub-chains like this.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The last steps of the chain are `llm`, which runs the inference, and `StrOutputParser()`, which just plucks the string content out of the LLM's output message.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can analyze the individual steps of this chain via its [LangSmith\n",
    "trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/1799e8db-8a6d-4eb2-84d5-46e8d7d5a99b/r).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in chains\n",
    "\n",
    "If preferred, LangChain includes convenience functions that implement the above LCEL. We compose two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [create_stuff_documents_chain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.combine_documents.stuff.create_stuff_documents_chain.html) specifies how retrieved context is fed into a prompt and LLM. In this case, we will \"stuff\" the contents into the prompt -- i.e., we will include all retrieved context without any summarization or other processing. It largely implements our above `rag_chain`, with input keys `context` and `input`-- it generates an answer using retrieved context and query.\n",
    "- [create_retrieval_chain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.retrieval.create_retrieval_chain.html) adds the retrieval step and propagates the retrieved context through the chain, providing it alongside the final answer. It has input key `input`, and includes `input`, `context`, and `answer` in its output."
