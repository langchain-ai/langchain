    "# Build a semantic search engine\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will familiarize you with LangChain's [document loader](/docs/concepts/document_loaders), [embedding](/docs/concepts/embedding_models), and [vector store](/docs/concepts/vectorstores) abstractions. These abstractions are designed to support retrieval of data--  from (vector) databases and other sources--  for integration with LLM workflows. They are important for applications that fetch data to be reasoned over as part of model inference, as in the case of retrieval-augmented generation, or [RAG](/docs/concepts/rag) (see our RAG tutorial [here](/docs/tutorials/rag)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will build a search engine over a PDF document. This will allow us to retrieve passages in the PDF that are similar to an input query.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide focuses on retrieval of text data. We will cover the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Documents and document loaders;\n",
    "- Text splitters;\n",
    "- Embeddings;\n",
    "- Vector stores and retrievers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial requires the `langchain-community` and `pypdf` packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\n",
    "import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n",
    "import CodeBlock from \"@theme/CodeBlock\";\n",

    "### LangSmith\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
    "As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\n",
    "The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "export LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"\n",
    "export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if in a notebook, you can set them with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import getpass\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_TRACING\"] = \"true\"\n",

    "\n",
    "LangChain implements a [Document](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html) abstraction, which is intended to represent a unit of text and associated metadata. It has three attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `page_content`: a string representing the content;\n",
    "- `metadata`: a dict containing arbitrary metadata;\n",
    "- `id`: (optional) a string identifier for the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `metadata` attribute can capture information about the source of the document, its relationship to other documents, and other information. Note that an individual `Document` object often represents a chunk of a larger document.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generate sample documents when desired:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_core.documents import Document\n",
    "\n",

    "    Document(\n",
