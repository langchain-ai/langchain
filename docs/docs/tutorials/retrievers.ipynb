    "# Vector stores and retrievers\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will familiarize you with LangChain's vector store and retriever abstractions. These abstractions are designed to support retrieval of data--  from (vector) databases and other sources--  for integration with LLM workflows. They are important for applications that fetch data to be reasoned over as part of model inference, as in the case of retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG (see our RAG tutorial [here](/docs/tutorials/rag)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide focuses on retrieval of text data. We will cover the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Documents;\n",
    "- Vector stores;\n",
    "- Retrievers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial requires the `langchain`, `langchain-chroma`, and `langchain-openai` packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{=mdx}\n",
    "import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\n",
    "import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n",
    "import CodeBlock from \"@theme/CodeBlock\";\n",
    "\n",
    "<Tabs>\n",
    "  <TabItem value=\"pip\" label=\"Pip\" default>\n",
    "    <CodeBlock language=\"bash\">pip install langchain langchain-chroma langchain-openai</CodeBlock>\n",
    "  </TabItem>\n",
    "  <TabItem value=\"conda\" label=\"Conda\">\n",
    "    <CodeBlock language=\"bash\">conda install langchain langchain-chroma langchain-openai -c conda-forge</CodeBlock>\n",
    "  </TabItem>\n",
    "</Tabs>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/how_to/installation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangSmith\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
    "As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\n",
    "The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\"true\"\n",
    "export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\"...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if in a notebook, you can set them with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import getpass\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2\"] = \"true\"\n",
    "os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain implements a [Document](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html) abstraction, which is intended to represent a unit of text and associated metadata. It has two attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `page_content`: a string representing the content;\n",
    "- `metadata`: a dict containing arbitrary metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `metadata` attribute can capture information about the source of the document, its relationship to other documents, and other information. Note that an individual `Document` object often represents a chunk of a larger document.\n",

    "\n",
    "Vector search is a common way to store and search over unstructured data (such as unstructured text). The idea is to store numeric vectors that are associated with the text. Given a query, we can [embed](/docs/concepts#embedding-models) it as a vector of the same dimension and use vector similarity metrics to identify related data in the store.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain [VectorStore](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/vectorstores/langchain_core.vectorstores.VectorStore.html) objects contain methods for adding text and `Document` objects to the store, and querying them using various similarity metrics. They are often initialized with [embedding](/docs/how_to/embed_text) models, which determine how text data is translated to numeric vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain includes a suite of [integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores) with different vector store technologies. Some vector stores are hosted by a provider (e.g., various cloud providers) and require specific credentials to use; some (such as [Postgres](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pgvector)) run in separate infrastructure that can be run locally or via a third-party; others can run in-memory for lightweight workloads. Here we will demonstrate usage of LangChain VectorStores using [Chroma](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/chroma), which includes an in-memory implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To instantiate a vector store, we often need to provide an [embedding](/docs/how_to/embed_text) model to specify how text should be converted into a numeric vector. Here we will use [OpenAI embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/openai/)."
