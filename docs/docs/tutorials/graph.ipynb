    "# Build a Question Answering application over a Graph Database\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide we'll go over the basic ways to create a Q&A chain over a graph database. These systems will allow us to ask a question about the data in a graph database and get back a natural language answer. First, we will show a simple out-of-the-box option and then implement a more sophisticated version with LangGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Security note ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "Building Q&A systems of graph databases requires executing model-generated graph queries. There are inherent risks in doing this. Make sure that your database connection permissions are always scoped as narrowly as possible for your chain/agent's needs. This will mitigate though not eliminate the risks of building a model-driven system. For more on general security best practices, [see here](/docs/security).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high-level, the steps of most graph chains are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert question to a graph database query**: Model converts user input to a graph database query (e.g. Cypher).\n",
    "2. **Execute graph database query**: Execute the graph database query.\n",
    "3. **Answer the question**: Model responds to user input using the query results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![sql_usecase.png](../../static/img/graph_usecase.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First, get required packages and set environment variables.\n",
