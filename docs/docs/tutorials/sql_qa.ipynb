    "# Build a Question/Answering system over SQL data\n",
    "\n",
    ":::info Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Chaining runnables](/docs/how_to/sequence/)\n",
    "- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/#chat-models)\n",
    "- [Tools](/docs/concepts/#tools)\n",

    "Enabling a LLM system to query structured data can be qualitatively different from unstructured text data. Whereas in the latter it is common to generate text that can be searched against a vector database, the approach for structured data is often for the LLM to write and execute queries in a DSL, such as SQL. In this guide we'll go over the basic ways to create a Q&A system over tabular data in databases. We will cover implementations using both chains and agents. These systems will allow us to ask a question about the data in a database and get back a natural language answer. The main difference between the two is that our agent can query the database in a loop as many times as it needs to answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Security note ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "Building Q&A systems of SQL databases requires executing model-generated SQL queries. There are inherent risks in doing this. Make sure that your database connection permissions are always scoped as narrowly as possible for your chain/agent's needs. This will mitigate though not eliminate the risks of building a model-driven system. For more on general security best practices, [see here](/docs/security).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high-level, the steps of these systems are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert question to DSL query**: Model converts user input to a SQL query.\n",
    "2. **Execute SQL query**: Execute the query.\n",
    "3. **Answer the question**: Model responds to user input using the query results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that querying data in CSVs can follow a similar approach. See our [how-to guide](/docs/how_to/sql_csv) on question-answering over CSV data for more detail.\n",
