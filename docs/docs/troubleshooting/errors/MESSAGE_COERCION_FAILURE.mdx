# MESSAGE_COERCION_FAILURE

Several modules in LangChain take [`MessageLike`](https://api.js.langchain.com/types/_langchain_core.messages.BaseMessageLike.html)
objects in place of formal [`BaseMessage`](/docs/concepts#message-types) classes. These include OpenAI style message objects (`{ role: "user", content: "Hello world!" }`),
tuples, and plain strings (which are converted to [`HumanMessages`](/docs/concepts#humanmessage)).

If one of these modules receives a value outside of one of these formats, you will receive an error like the following:

```ts
const badlyFormattedMessageObject = {
  role: "foo",
  randomNonContentValue: "bar",
};

await model.invoke([badlyFormattedMessageObject]);
```

```
Error: Unable to coerce message from array: only human, AI, system, or tool message coercion is currently supported.

Received: {
  "role": "foo",
  "randomNonContentValue": "bar",
}
```

## Troubleshooting

The following may help resolve this error:

- Ensure that all inputs to chat models are an array of LangChain message classes or a supported message-like.
  - Check that there is no stringification or other unexpected transformation occuring.
- Check the error's stack trace and add log or debugger statements.
