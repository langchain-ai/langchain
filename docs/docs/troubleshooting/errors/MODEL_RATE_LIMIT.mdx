# MODEL_RATE_LIMIT

You have hit the maximum number of requests that a model provider allows over a given time period and are being temporarily blocked.
Generally, this error is temporary and your limit will reset after a certain amount of time.

## Troubleshooting

The following may help resolve this error:

- Contact your model provider and ask for a rate limit increase.
- If many of your incoming requests are the same, utilize [model response caching](/docs/how_to/chat_model_caching/).
- Spread requests across different providers if your application allows it.
- Use a [`rate_limiter`](/docs/how_to/chat_model_rate_limiting/) to control the rate of requests to the model.
