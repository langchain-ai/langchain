# AWS

The `LangChain` integrations related to [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) platform.

First-party AWS integrations are available in the `langchain_aws` package.

```bash
pip install langchain-aws
```

And there are also some community integrations available in the `langchain_community` package with the `boto3` optional dependency.

```bash
pip install langchain-community boto3
```

## Chat models

### Bedrock Chat

>[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is a fully managed service that offers a choice of 
> high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like `AI21 Labs`, `Anthropic`, `Cohere`, 
> `Meta`, `Stability AI`, and `Amazon` via a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to 
> build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using `Amazon Bedrock`, 
> you can easily experiment with and evaluate top FMs for your use case, privately customize them with 
> your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and `Retrieval Augmented Generation` (`RAG`), and build 
> agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems and data sources. Since `Amazon Bedrock` is 
> serverless, you don't have to manage any infrastructure, and you can securely integrate and deploy 
> generative AI capabilities into your applications using the AWS services you are already familiar with.

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/chat/bedrock).

```python
from langchain_aws import ChatBedrock
```

### Bedrock Converse
AWS has recently released the Bedrock Converse API which provides a unified conversational interface for Bedrock models. This API does not yet support custom models. You can see a list of all [models that are supported here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference.html). To improve reliability the ChatBedrock integration will switch to using the Bedrock Converse API as soon as it has feature parity with the existing Bedrock API. Until then a separate [ChatBedrockConverse](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/aws/chat_models/langchain_aws.chat_models.bedrock_converse.ChatBedrockConverse.html) integration has been released.

We recommend using `ChatBedrockConverse` for users who do not need to use custom models. See the [docs](/docs/integrations/chat/bedrock/#bedrock-converse-api) and [API reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/aws/chat_models/langchain_aws.chat_models.bedrock_converse.ChatBedrockConverse.html) for more detail.

```python
from langchain_aws import ChatBedrockConverse
```

## LLMs

### Amazon API Gateway

>[Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) is a fully managed service that makes it easy for 
> developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" 
> for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using 
> `API Gateway`, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication 
> applications. `API Gateway` supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.
> 
> `API Gateway` handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of 
> concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, 
> throttling, monitoring, and API version management. `API Gateway` has no minimum fees or startup costs. 
> You pay for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out and, with the `API Gateway` 
> tiered pricing model, you can reduce your cost as your API usage scales.

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/llms/amazon_api_gateway).
