# Hugging Face

All functionality related to the [Hugging Face Platform](https://huggingface.co/).

## LLMs

### Hugging Face Hub

>The [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index) is a platform 
> with over 350k models, 75k datasets, and 150k demo apps (Spaces), all open source 
> and publicly available, in an online platform where people can easily 
> collaborate and build ML together. The Hub works as a central place where anyone 
> can explore, experiment, collaborate, and build technology with Machine Learning.

To use, we should have the `huggingface_hub` python [package installed](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/installation).

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
```

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/llms/huggingface_hub).

```python
from langchain.llms import HuggingFaceHub
```

### Hugging Face Local Pipelines

Hugging Face models can be run locally through the `HuggingFacePipeline` class.

We need to install `transformers` python package.

```bash
pip install transformers
```

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/llms/huggingface_pipelines).

```python
from langchain.llms.huggingface_pipeline import HuggingFacePipeline
```

### Hugging Face TextGen Inference

>[Text Generation Inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference) is 
> a Rust, Python and gRPC server for text generation inference. Used in production at 
> [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) to power LLMs api-inference widgets.

We need to install `text_generation` python package.

```bash
pip install text_generation
```

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/llms/huggingface_textgen_inference).

```python
from langchain.llms import HuggingFaceTextGenInference
```



## Document Loaders

### Hugging Face dataset

>[Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index) is home to over 75,000 
> [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index#datasets) in more than 100 languages 
> that can be used for a broad range of tasks across NLP, Computer Vision, and Audio.
> They used for a diverse range of tasks such as translation, automatic speech 
> recognition, and image classification.

We need to install `datasets` python package.

```bash
pip install datasets
```

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/hugging_face_dataset).

```python
from langchain.document_loaders.hugging_face_dataset import HuggingFaceDatasetLoader
```


## Embedding Models

### Hugging Face Hub

>The [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index) is a platform 
> with over 350k models, 75k datasets, and 150k demo apps (Spaces), all open source 
> and publicly available, in an online platform where people can easily 
> collaborate and build ML together. The Hub works as a central place where anyone 
> can explore, experiment, collaborate, and build technology with Machine Learning.

We need to install the `sentence_transformers` python package.

```bash
pip install sentence_transformers
```


#### HuggingFaceEmbeddings

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/huggingfacehub).

```python
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
```
#### HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/instruct_embeddings).

```python
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings
```

#### HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings

>[BGE models on the HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en) are [the best open-source embedding models](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard).
>BGE model is created by the [Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI)](https://www.baai.ac.cn/english.html). `BAAI` is a private non-profit organization engaged in AI research and development.

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/bge_huggingface).

```python
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings
```


## Tools

### Hugging Face Hub Tools

>[Hugging Face Tools](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.29.0/en/custom_tools) 
> support text I/O and are loaded using the `load_huggingface_tool` function.

We need to install several python packages.

```bash
pip install transformers huggingface_hub
```

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/tools/huggingface_tools).

```python
from langchain.agents import load_huggingface_tool
```
