[AI agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/ai-agents) needs robust memory systems that support multi-modality, offer strong operational performance, and enable agent memory sharing as well as separation.

### Azure Cosmos DB
AI agents can rely on Azure Cosmos DB as a unified [memory system](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/ai-agents#memory-can-make-or-break-agents) solution, enjoying speed, scale, and simplicity. This service successfully [enabled OpenAI's ChatGPT service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IIUtEFKJec&t) to scale dynamically with high reliability and low maintenance. Powered by an atom-record-sequence engine, it is the world's first globally distributed [NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/distributed-nosql), [relational](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/distributed-relational), and [vector database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/vector-database) service that offers a serverless mode. 

Below are two available Azure Cosmos DB APIs that can provide vector store functionalities.

### Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore)

>[Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/vcore/) makes it easy to create a database with full native MongoDB support.
> You can apply your MongoDB experience and continue to use your favorite MongoDB drivers, SDKs, and tools by pointing your application to the API for MongoDB vCore account's connection string.
> Use vector search in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore to seamlessly integrate your AI-based applications with your data that's stored in Azure Cosmos DB.

#### Installation and Setup

See [detail configuration instructions](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/azure_cosmos_db).

We need to install `pymongo` python package.

```bash
pip install pymongo
```

#### Deploy Azure Cosmos DB on Microsoft Azure

### Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL

>[Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/vector-search) now offers vector indexing and search in preview.
This feature is designed to handle high-dimensional vectors, enabling efficient and accurate vector search at any scale. You can now store vectors
directly in the documents alongside your data. This means that each document in your database can contain not only traditional schema-free data,
but also high-dimensional vectors as other properties of the documents. This colocation of data and vectors allows for efficient indexing and searching,
as the vectors are stored in the same logical unit as the data they represent. This simplifies data management, AI application architectures, and the
efficiency of vector-based operations.

#### Installation and Setup

See [detail configuration instructions](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/azure_cosmos_db_no_sql).

We need to install `azure-cosmos` python package.

```bash
pip install azure-cosmos
```
