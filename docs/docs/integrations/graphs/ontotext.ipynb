    "\n",
    "* `query_ontology`: a `CONSTRUCT` query that is executed on the SPARQL endpoint and returns the KG schema statements. We recommend that you store the ontology in its own named graph, which will make it easier to get only the relevant statements (as the example below). `DESCRIBE` queries are not supported, because `DESCRIBE` returns the Symmetric Concise Bounded Description (SCBD), i.e. also the incoming class links. In case of large graphs with a million of instances, this is not efficient. Check https://github.com/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/4857\n",
    "* `local_file`: a local RDF ontology file. Supported RDF formats are `Turtle`, `RDF/XML`, `JSON-LD`, `N-Triples`, `Notation-3`, `Trig`, `Trix`, `N-Quads`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, the ontology dump should:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Include enough information about classes, properties, property attachment to classes (using rdfs:domain, schema:domainIncludes or OWL restrictions), and taxonomies (important individuals).\n",
