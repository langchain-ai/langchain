    "# Google Cloud Vertex AI Reranker\n",
    "\n",
    "> The [Vertex Search Ranking API](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/ranking) is one of the standalone APIs in [Vertex AI Agent Builder](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/builder-apis). It takes a list of documents and reranks those documents based on how relevant the documents are to a query. Compared to embeddings, which look only at the semantic similarity of a document and a query, the ranking API can give you precise scores for how well a document answers a given query. The ranking API can be used to improve the quality of search results after retrieving an initial set of candidate documents.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The ranking API is stateless so there's no need to index documents before calling the API. All you need to do is pass in the query and documents. This makes the API well suited for reranking documents from any document retrievers.\n",
    "\n",
