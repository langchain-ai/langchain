    "- [Python script](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/json-schema-to-grammar.py) for converting json schema to gbnf file. You can for example create `pydantic` object, generate its JSON schema using `.schema_json()` method, and then use this script to convert it to gbnf file."
