In 1775, fighting broke out between British troops and American militiamen in Lexington and Concord, starting the Revolutionary War. The Continental Congress appointed George Washington as commander of the Continental Army, which went on to win key victories over the British. In 1776, the Declaration of Independence was adopted, formally declaring the 13 American colonies free from British rule. After years of fighting, the Revolutionary War ended with the British defeat at Yorktown in 1781 and recognition of American independence.')], [Generation(text=\" Here's a humorous take on explaining rocket science:\\n\\nRocket science is so easy, it's practically child's play! Just strap a big metal tube full of explosive liquid to your butt and light the fuse. What could go wrong? Blastoff!  Whoosh, you'll be zooming to the moon in no time. Just remember your helmet or your head might go pop like a zit when you leave the atmosphere. \\n\\nMaking rockets is a cinch too. Simply mix together some spicy spices, garlic powder, chili powder, a dash of gunpowder and voila - rocket fuel! Add a pinch of baking soda and vinegar if you want an extra kick. Shake well and pour into your DIY soda bottle rocket. Stand back and watch that baby soar!\\n\\nGuiding a rocket is fun for the whole family. Just strap in, push some random buttons and see where you end up. It's like the ultimate surprise vacation! You never know if you'll wind up on Venus, crash land on Mars, or take a quick dip through the rings of Saturn. \\n\\nAnd if anything goes wrong, don't sweat it. Rocket science is easy breezy.
