    "# Llamafile\n",
    "\n",
    "[Llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile) lets you distribute and run LLMs with a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Llamafile does this by combining [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) with [Cosmopolitan Libc](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan) into one framework that collapses all the complexity of LLMs down to a single-file executable (called a \"llamafile\") that runs locally on most computers, with no installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download a llamafile for the model you'd like to use. You can find many models in llamafile format on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models?other=llamafile). In this guide, we will download a small one, `TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M`. Note: if you don't have `wget`, you can just download the model via this [link](https://huggingface.co/jartine/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF/resolve/main/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile?download=true).\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wget https://huggingface.co/jartine/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF/resolve/main/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make the llamafile executable. First, if you haven't done so already, open a terminal. **If you're using MacOS, Linux, or BSD,** you'll need to grant permission for your computer to execute this new file using `chmod` (see below). **If you're on Windows,** rename the file by adding \".exe\" to the end (model file should be named `TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile.exe`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "chmod +x TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile  # run if you're on MacOS, Linux, or BSD\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run the llamafile in \"server mode\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile --server --nobrowser\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can make calls to the llamafile's REST API. By default, the llamafile server listens at http://localhost:8080. You can find full server documentation [here](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/blob/main/llama.cpp/server/README.md#api-endpoints). You can interact with the llamafile directly via the REST API, but here we'll show how to interact with it using LangChain.\n"
