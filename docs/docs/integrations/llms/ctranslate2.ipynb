Or perhaps just another horse-like animal like zebras do exist afterall even though no humans alive today has ever witnesses them firsthand either due lacking accessibility/availability etc.. But then again those animals aren’ t exactly known around here anyway…” And thus began our discussion about whether these creatures actually existed anywhere else outside Earth itself where only few scientists ventured before us nowadays because technology allows exploration beyond borders once thought impossible centuries ago when travel meant walking everywhere yourself until reaching destination point A->B via footsteps alone unless someone helped guide along way through woods full darkness nighttime hours\n"
