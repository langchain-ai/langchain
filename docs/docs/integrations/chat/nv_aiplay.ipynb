    "\n",
    "NVidia also supports multimodal inputs, meaning you can provide both images and text for the model to reason over.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models also accept `labels`, similar to the Steering LLMs above. In addition to `creativity`, `complexity`, and `verbosity`, these models support a `quality` toggle.\n",
