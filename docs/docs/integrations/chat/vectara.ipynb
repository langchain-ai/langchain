    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, use the following steps:\n",
    "1. If you don't already have one, [Sign up](https://www.vectara.com/integrations/langchain) for your free Vectara trial.\n",
    "2. Within your account, you can create one or more corpora. Each corpus represents an area that stores text data upon ingestion from input documents. To create a corpus, use the **\"Create Corpus\"** button. You then provide a name to your corpus as well as a description. Optionally, you can define filtering attributes and apply some advanced options. If you click on your created corpus, you can see its name and corpus ID right on the top.\n",
    "3. Next, you'll need to create API keys to access the corpus. Click on the **\"Access Control\"** tab in the corpus view and then the **\"Create API Key\"** button. Give your key a name, and choose whether you want query-only or query+index for your key. Click \"Create\", and you now have an active API key. Keep this key confidential. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use LangChain with Vectara, you'll need to have these two values: `corpus_key` and `api_key`.\n",
    "You can provide `VECTARA_API_KEY` to LangChain in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instantiation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Include in your environment these two variables: `VECTARA_API_KEY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, you can set these variables using os.environ and getpass as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import getpass\n",
    "\n",
    "os.environ[\"VECTARA_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"Vectara API Key:\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add them to the `Vectara` vectorstore constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "vectara = Vectara(\n",
    "    vectara_api_key=vectara_api_key\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we assume they are provided in the environment."
