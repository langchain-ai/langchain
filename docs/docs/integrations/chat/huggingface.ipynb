    "This notebook shows how to get started using `Hugging Face` LLM's as chat models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will:\n",
    "1. Utilize the [HuggingFaceTextGenInference](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/libs/langchain/langchain/llms/huggingface_text_gen_inference.py), [HuggingFaceEndpoint](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/libs/langchain/langchain/llms/huggingface_endpoint.py), or [HuggingFaceHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/libs/langchain/langchain/llms/huggingface_hub.py) integrations to instantiate an `LLM`.\n",
    "2. Utilize the `ChatHuggingFace` class to enable any of these LLMs to interface with LangChain's [Chat Messages](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/chat/#messages) abstraction.\n",
    "3. Demonstrate how to use an open-source LLM to power an `ChatAgent` pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: To get started, you'll need to have a [Hugging Face Access Token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) saved as an environment variable: `HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN`."

      "According to a popular philosophical paradox, when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object, it is impossible to determine which one will prevail because both are defined as being completely unyielding and unmovable. The paradox suggests that the very concepts of \"unstoppable force\" and \"immovable object\" are inherently contradictory, and therefore, it is illogical to imagine a scenario where they would meet and interact. However, in practical terms, it is highly unlikely for such a scenario to occur in the real world, as the concepts of \"unstoppable force\" and \"immovable object\" are often used metaphorically to describe hypothetical situations or abstract concepts, rather than physical objects or forces.\n"
