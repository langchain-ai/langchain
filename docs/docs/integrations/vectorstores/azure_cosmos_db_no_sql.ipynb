    "Azure Cosmos DB is the database that powers OpenAI's ChatGPT service. It offers single-digit millisecond response times, automatic and instant scalability, along with guaranteed speed at any scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL now offers vector indexing and search in preview. This feature is designed to handle high-dimensional vectors, enabling efficient and accurate vector search at any scale. You can now store vectors directly in the documents alongside your data. This means that each document in your database can contain not only traditional schema-free data, but also high-dimensional vectors as other properties of the documents. This colocation of data and vectors allows for efficient indexing and searching, as the vectors are stored in the same logical unit as the data they represent. This simplifies data management, AI application architectures, and the efficiency of vector-based operations.\n",

While less capable than\\nhumans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance\\non various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated\\nbar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-\\nbased model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training\\nalignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and\\nadherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing\\ninfrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide\\nrange of scales.

Such models are an important area of study as they have the\\npotential to be used in a wide range of applications, such as dialogue systems, text summarization,\\nand machine translation. As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in\\nrecent years [1–34].\\nOne of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate\\nnatural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios. To test its capabilities\\nin such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans. In\\nthese evaluations it performs quite well and often outscores the vast majority of human test takers.\",\"type\":\"Document\"}\n",

The\\nprimary reason is that for very large training runs like GPT-4, it is not feasible to do extensive\\nmodel-specific tuning. To address this, we developed infrastructure and optimization methods that\\nhave very predictable behavior across multiple scales. These improvements allowed us to reliably\\npredict some aspects of the performance of GPT-4 from smaller models trained using 1,000×–\\n10,000×less compute.\\n3.1 Loss Prediction\\nThe final loss of properly-trained large language models is thought to be well approximated by power\\nlaws in the amount of compute used to train the model [41, 42, 2, 14, 15].\\nTo verify the scalability of our optimization infrastructure, we predicted GPT-4’s final loss on our\",\"type\":\"Document\"}\n",
