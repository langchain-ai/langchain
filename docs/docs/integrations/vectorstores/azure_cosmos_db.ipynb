    ">[Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/vcore/) makes it easy to create a database with full native MongoDB support.\n",
    "> You can apply your MongoDB experience and continue to use your favorite MongoDB drivers, SDKs, and tools by pointing your application to the API for MongoDB vCore account's connection string.\n",
    "> Use vector search in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore to seamlessly integrate your AI-based applications with your data that's stored in Azure Cosmos DB.\n",
