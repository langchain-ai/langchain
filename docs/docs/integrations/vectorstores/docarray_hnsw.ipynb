    ">[DocArrayHnswSearch](https://docs.docarray.org/user_guide/storing/index_hnswlib/) is a lightweight Document Index implementation provided by [Docarray](https://github.com/docarray/docarray) that runs fully locally and is best suited for small- to medium-sized datasets. It stores vectors on disk in [hnswlib](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib), and stores all other data in [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).\n",
