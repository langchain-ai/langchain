    "SingleStoreDB presents a diverse range of search strategies, each meticulously crafted to cater to specific use cases and user preferences. The default `VECTOR_ONLY` strategy utilizes vector operations such as `dot_product` or `euclidean_distance` to calculate similarity scores directly between vectors, while `TEXT_ONLY` employs Lucene-based full-text search, particularly advantageous for text-centric applications. For users seeking a balanced approach, `FILTER_BY_TEXT` first refines results based on text similarity before conducting vector comparisons, whereas `FILTER_BY_VECTOR` prioritizes vector similarity, filtering results before assessing text similarity for optimal matches. Notably, both `FILTER_BY_TEXT` and `FILTER_BY_VECTOR` necessitate a full-text index for operation. Additionally, `WEIGHTED_SUM` emerges as a sophisticated strategy, calculating the final similarity score by weighing vector and text similarities, albeit exclusively utilizing dot_product distance calculations and also requiring a full-text index. These versatile strategies empower users to fine-tune searches according to their unique needs, facilitating efficient and precise data retrieval and analysis. Moreover, SingleStoreDB's hybrid approaches, exemplified by `FILTER_BY_TEXT`, `FILTER_BY_VECTOR`, and `WEIGHTED_SUM` strategies, seamlessly blend vector and text-based searches to maximize efficiency and accuracy, ensuring users can fully leverage the platform's capabilities for a wide range of applications."

One powerful tool facilitating such integration is [CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip), a cutting-edge model capable of embedding both images and text into a shared semantic space. By doing so, CLIP enables the retrieval of relevant content across different modalities through similarity search.\n",

    "To illustrate, let's consider an application scenario where we aim to effectively analyze multi-modal data. In this example, we harness the capabilities of [OpenClip multimodal embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/open_clip), which leverage CLIP's framework. With OpenClip, we can seamlessly embed textual descriptions alongside corresponding images, enabling comprehensive analysis and retrieval tasks. Whether it's identifying visually similar images based on textual queries or finding relevant text passages associated with specific visual content, OpenClip empowers users to explore and extract insights from multi-modal data with remarkable efficiency and accuracy."
