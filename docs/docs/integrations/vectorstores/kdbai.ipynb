      "According to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789, the rights and duties of man, citizen, and society are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Rights of Man:\n",
      "1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions can only be based on common utility.\n",
      "2. The purpose of political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man, which are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.\n",
      "3. The principle of sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. No body or individual can exercise any authority that does not emanate expressly from it.\n",
      "4. Liberty consists of being able to do anything that does not harm others. The exercise of natural rights of each man has no limits other than those that ensure the enjoyment of these same rights by other members of society. These limits can only be determined by law.\n",
      "5. The law has the right to prohibit only actions harmful to society. Anything not prohibited by law cannot be prevented, and no one can be compelled to do what it does not command.\n",
      "6. The law is the expression of the general will. All citizens have the right to participate personally, or through their representatives, in its formation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. All citizens, being equal in its eyes, are equally eligible to all public dignities, places, and employments, according to their abilities, and without other distinction than that of their virtues and talents.\n",
      "7. No man can be accused, arrested, or detained except in cases determined by law and according to the forms it has prescribed. Those who solicit, expedite, execute, or cause to be executed arbitrary orders must be punished. But any citizen called or seized in virtue of the law must obey instantly; he renders himself culpable by resistance.\n",
      "8. The law should establish only strictly and evidently necessary penalties, and no one can be punished except in virtue of a law established and promulgated prior to the offense, and legally applied.\n",
      "9. Every man being presumed innocent until he has been declared guilty, if it is judged indispensable to arrest him, any rigor that is not necessary to secure his person must be severely repressed by the law.\n",
      "10. No one should be disturbed for his opinions, even religious ones, as long as their manifestation does not disturb the established public order by law.\n",
      "11. The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious rights of man. Every citizen may therefore speak, write, and print freely, except to respond to the abuse of this liberty in cases determined by law.\n",
      "12. The guarantee of the rights of man and of the citizen requires a public force. This force is therefore instituted for the advantage of all and not for the particular utility of those to whom it is entrusted.\n",
      "13. For the maintenance of the public force and for the expenses of administration, a common contribution is necessary. It must be equally distributed among all citizens, in proportion to their abilities.\n",
      "14. All citizens have the right to ascertain, by themselves or through their representatives, the necessity of the public contribution, to consent to it freely, to follow its use, and to determine its amount, basis, collection, and duration.\n",
      "15. Society has the right to ask any public agent for an account of his administration.\n",
      "16. Any society in which the guarantee of rights is not assured, nor the separation of powers determined, has no constitution.\n",
      "17. Property being an inviolable and sacred right, no one can be deprived of it, except when public necessity, legally determined, obviously requires it, and under the condition of a just and prior indemnity.\n",

      "Duties of the Citizen:\n",
