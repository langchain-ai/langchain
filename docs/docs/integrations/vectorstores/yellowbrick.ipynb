    "[Yellowbrick](https://yellowbrick.com/yellowbrick-data-warehouse/) is an elastic, massively parallel processing (MPP) SQL database that runs in the cloud and on-premises, using kubernetes for scale, resilience and cloud portability. Yellowbrick is designed to address the largest and most complex business-critical data warehousing use cases. The efficiency at scale that Yellowbrick provides also enables it to be used as a high performance and scalable vector database to store and search vectors with SQL. \n"

    "This tutorial demonstrates how to create a simple chatbot backed by ChatGpt that uses Yellowbrick as a vector store to support Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). What you'll need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An account on the [Yellowbrick sandbox](https://cloudlabs.yellowbrick.com/)\n",
    "2. An api key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is divided into five parts. First we'll use langchain to create a baseline chatbot to interact with ChatGpt without a vector store. Second, we'll create an embeddings table in Yellowbrick that will represent the vector store. Third, we'll load a series of documents (the Administration chapter of the Yellowbrick Manual). Fourth, we'll create the vector representation of those documents and store in a Yellowbrick table.  Lastly, we'll send the same queries to the improved chatbox to see the results.\n"
