    ">[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/) (read: quadrant ) is a vector similarity search engine. It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage vectors with additional payload and extended filtering support. It makes it useful for all sorts of neural network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation demonstrates how to use Qdrant with Langchain for dense/sparse and hybrid retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This page documents the `QdrantVectorStore` class that supports multiple retrieval modes via Qdrant's new [Query API](https://qdrant.tech/blog/qdrant-1.10.x/). It requires you to run Qdrant v1.10.0 or above.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various modes of how to run `Qdrant`, and depending on the chosen one, there will be some subtle differences. The options include:\n",
    "- Local mode, no server required\n",
    "- Docker deployments\n",
