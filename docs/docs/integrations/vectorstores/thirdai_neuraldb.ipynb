    "2. Upvoting: the vectorstore upweights the score of a document for a specific query. This is useful when you want to fine-tune the vectorstore to user behavior. For example, if a user searches \"how is a car manufactured\" and likes the returned document with id 52, then we can upvote the document with id 52 for the query \"how is a car manufactured\"."
