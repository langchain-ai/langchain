    ">[LLMRails](https://www.llmrails.com/) is a API platform for building GenAI applications. It provides an easy-to-use API for document indexing and querying that is managed by LLMRails and is optimized for performance and accuracy. \n",
    "See the [LLMRails API documentation ](https://docs.llmrails.com/) for more information on how to use the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to install `langchain-community` with `pip install -qU langchain-community` to use this integration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the `LLMRails`'s integration with langchain.\n",
    "Note that unlike many other integrations in this category, LLMRails provides an end-to-end managed service for retrieval augmented generation, which includes:\n",
    "1. A way to extract text from document files and chunk them into sentences.\n",
    "2. Its own embeddings model and vector store - each text segment is encoded into a vector embedding and stored in the LLMRails internal vector store\n",
    "3. A query service that automatically encodes the query into embedding, and retrieves the most relevant text segments (including support for [Hybrid Search](https://docs.llmrails.com/datastores/search))\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are supported in this LangChain integration."

    "2. Next you'll need to create API keys to access the API. Click on the **\"API Keys\"** tab in the corpus view and then the **\"Create API Key\"** button. Give your key a name. Click \"Create key\" and you now have an active API key. Keep this key confidential. \n",
