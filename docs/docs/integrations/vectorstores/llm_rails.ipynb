    "# LLMRails\n",
    "\n",
    ">[LLMRails](https://www.llmrails.com/) is a API platform for building GenAI applications. It provides an easy-to-use API for document indexing and querying that is managed by LLMRails and is optimized for performance and accuracy. \n",
    "See the [LLMRails API documentation ](https://docs.llmrails.com/) for more information on how to use the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the `LLMRails`'s integration with langchain.\n",
    "Note that unlike many other integrations in this category, LLMRails provides an end-to-end managed service for retrieval augmented generation, which includes:\n",
    "1. A way to extract text from document files and chunk them into sentences.\n",
    "2. Its own embeddings model and vector store - each text segment is encoded into a vector embedding and stored in the LLMRails internal vector store\n",
    "3. A query service that automatically encodes the query into embedding, and retrieves the most relevant text segments (including support for [Hybrid Search](https://docs.llmrails.com/datastores/search))\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are supported in this LangChain integration."

    "\n",
    "You will need a LLMRails account to use LLMRails with LangChain. To get started, use the following steps:\n",
    "1. [Sign up](https://console.llmrails.com/signup) for a LLMRails account if you don't already have one.\n",
    "2. Next you'll need to create API keys to access the API. Click on the **\"API Keys\"** tab in the corpus view and then the **\"Create API Key\"** button. Give your key a name. Click \"Create key\" and you now have an active API key. Keep this key confidential. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use LangChain with LLMRails, you'll need to have this value: api_key.\n",
    "You can provide those to LangChain in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Include in your environment these two variables: `LLM_RAILS_API_KEY`, `LLM_RAILS_DATASTORE_ID`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, you can set these variables using os.environ and getpass as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import getpass\n",
    "\n",
    "os.environ[\"LLM_RAILS_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"LLMRails API Key:\")\n",
    "os.environ[\"LLM_RAILS_DATASTORE_ID\"] = getpass.getpass(\"LLMRails Datastore Id:\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provide them as arguments when creating the LLMRails vectorstore object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "vectorstore = LLMRails(\n",
    "    api_key=llm_rails_api_key,\n",
