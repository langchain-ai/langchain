    "# Zep\n",
    "\n",
    ">[Zep](https://docs.getzep.com/) is an open-source platform for LLM apps. Go from a prototype\n",
    ">built in LangChain or LlamaIndex, or a custom app, to production in minutes without rewriting code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fast!** `Zep` operates independently of your chat loop, ensuring a snappy user experience.\n",
    "- **Chat History Memory, Archival, and Enrichment**, populate your prompts with relevant chat history, summaries, named entities, intent data, and more.\n",
    "- **Vector Search over Chat History and Documents** Automatic embedding of documents, chat histories, and summaries. Use Zep's similarity or native MMR Re-ranked search to find the most relevant.\n",
    "- **Manage Users and their Chat Sessions** Users and their Chat Sessions are first-class citizens in Zep, allowing you to manage user interactions with your bots or agents easily.\n",
    "- **Records Retention and Privacy Compliance** Comply with corporate and regulatory mandates for records retention while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations such as CCPA and GDPR. Fulfill *Right To Be Forgotten* requests with a single API call\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The `ZepVectorStore` works with `Documents` and is intended to be used as a `Retriever`.\n",
    "It offers separate functionality to Zep's `ZepMemory` class, which is designed for persisting, enriching\n",
    "and searching your user's chat history.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the [Zep Quickstart Guide](https://docs.getzep.com/deployment/quickstart/) to install and get started with Zep.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need your Zep API URL and optionally an API key to use the Zep VectorStore. \n",
    "See the [Zep docs](https://docs.getzep.com) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples below, we're using Zep's auto-embedding feature which automatically embeds documents on the Zep server \n",
    "using low-latency embedding models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "- These examples use Zep's async interfaces. Call sync interfaces by removing the `a` prefix from the method names.\n",
    "- If you pass in an `Embeddings` instance Zep will use this to embed documents rather than auto-embed them.\n",
    "You must also set your document collection to `isAutoEmbedded === false`. \n",
    "- If you set your collection to `isAutoEmbedded === false`, you must pass in an `Embeddings` instance."
