    "# ManticoreSearch VectorStore\n",
    "\n",
    "[ManticoreSearch](https://manticoresearch.com/) is an open-source search engine that offers fast, scalable, and user-friendly capabilities. Originating as a fork of [Sphinx Search](http://sphinxsearch.com/), it has evolved to incorporate modern search engine features and improvements. ManticoreSearch distinguishes itself with its robust performance and ease of integration into various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "ManticoreSearch has recently introduced [vector search capabilities](https://manual.manticoresearch.com/dev/Searching/KNN), starting with search engine version 6.2 and only with [manticore-columnar-lib](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/columnar) package installed. This feature is a considerable advancement, allowing for the execution of searches based on vector similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of now, the vector search functionality is only accessible in the developmental (dev) versions of the search engine. Consequently, it is imperative to employ a developmental [manticoresearch-dev](https://pypi.org/project/manticoresearch-dev/) Python client for utilizing this feature effectively."
