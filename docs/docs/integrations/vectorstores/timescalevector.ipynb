    "# Timescale Vector (Postgres)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use the Postgres vector database `Timescale Vector`. You'll learn how to use TimescaleVector for (1) semantic search, (2) time-based vector search, (3) self-querying, and (4) how to create indexes to speed up queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Timescale Vector?\n",
    "**[Timescale Vector](https://www.timescale.com/ai) is PostgreSQL++ for AI applications.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Timescale Vector enables you to efficiently store and query millions of vector embeddings in `PostgreSQL`.\n",
    "- Enhances `pgvector` with faster and more accurate similarity search on 100M+ vectors via `DiskANN` inspired indexing algorithm.\n",
    "- Enables fast time-based vector search via automatic time-based partitioning and indexing.\n",
    "- Provides a familiar SQL interface for querying vector embeddings and relational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timescale Vector is cloud PostgreSQL for AI that scales with you from POC to production:\n",
    "- Simplifies operations by enabling you to store relational metadata, vector embeddings, and time-series data in a single database.\n",
    "- Benefits from rock-solid PostgreSQL foundation with enterprise-grade feature liked streaming backups and replication, high-availability and row-level security.\n",
    "- Enables a worry-free experience with enterprise-grade security and compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to access Timescale Vector\n",
    "Timescale Vector is available on [Timescale](https://www.timescale.com/ai), the cloud PostgreSQL platform. (There is no self-hosted version at this time.)\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain users get a 90-day free trial for Timescale Vector.\n",
    "- To get started, [signup](https://console.cloud.timescale.com/signup?utm_campaign=vectorlaunch&utm_source=langchain&utm_medium=referral) to Timescale, create a new database and follow this notebook!\n",
    "- See the [Timescale Vector explainer blog](https://www.timescale.com/blog/how-we-made-postgresql-the-best-vector-database/?utm_campaign=vectorlaunch&utm_source=langchain&utm_medium=referral) for more details and performance benchmarks.\n",
    "- See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/timescale/python-vector) for more details on using Timescale Vector in python."
