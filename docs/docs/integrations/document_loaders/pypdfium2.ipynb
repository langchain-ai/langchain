Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\\nprimarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\\noutcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\\ninvestigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\\nand sophisticated model configurations complicate the easy reuse of im\\x02portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\\nefforts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\\ndevelopment in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\\nvision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\\nThis represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\\nacademic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\\nand humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source\\nlibrary for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica\\x02tions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and\\nintuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de\\x02tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.\\nTo promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community\\nplatform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti\\x02zation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both\\nlightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.\\nThe library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.\\nKeywords: Document Image Analysis· Deep Learning· Layout Analysis\\n· Character Recognition· Open Source library· Toolkit.\\n1 Introduction\\nDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of\\ndocument image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classification [11,\\narXiv:2103.15348v2 [cs.CV] 21 Jun 2021\\n')"

      "methods. DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and benefit a broad\n",
      "spectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\n",
      "However, there are several practical difficulties for taking advantages of re\u0002cent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted\n",
      "for reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame\u0002works like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can\n",
      "be obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and\n",
      "frustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,\n",
      "and many researchers who would benefit the most from using these methods lack\n",
      "the technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images\n",
      "contain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\n",
      "is often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no\n",
      "full-fledged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\n",
      "and fine-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\n",
      "models and other processing to obtain the final outputs. Often research teams use\n",
      "DL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\n",
      "and these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\n",
      "documented at all). This makes it difficult for research teams to learn about how\n",
      "full pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest significant resources in\n",
