    "## Overview\n",
    "`ZeroxPDFLoader` is a document loader that leverages the [Zerox](https://github.com/getomni-ai/zerox) library. Zerox converts PDF documents into images, processes them using a vision-capable language model, and generates a structured Markdown representation. This loader allows for asynchronous operations and provides page-level document extraction.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Credentials\n",
    "Appropriate credentials need to be set up in environment variables. The loader supports number of different models and model providers. See _Usage_ header below to see few examples or [Zerox documentation](https://github.com/getomni-ai/zerox) for a full list of supported models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "To use `ZeroxPDFLoader`, you need to install the `zerox` package. Also make sure to have `langchain-community` installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install zerox langchain-community\n",

    "If you're working in an environment like Jupyter Notebook, you may need to handle asynchronous code by using `nest_asyncio`. You can set this up as follows:\n",
