    "## Quick start\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a [Docugami workspace](http://www.docugami.com) (free trials available)\n",
    "2. Add your documents (PDF, DOCX or DOC) and allow Docugami to ingest and cluster them into sets of similar documents, e.g. NDAs, Lease Agreements, and Service Agreements. There is no fixed set of document types supported by the system, the clusters created depend on your particular documents, and you can [change the docset assignments](https://help.docugami.com/home/working-with-the-doc-sets-view) later.\n",
    "3. Create an access token via the Developer Playground for your workspace. [Detailed instructions](https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api)\n",
    "4. Explore the [Docugami API](https://api-docs.docugami.com) to get a list of your processed docset IDs, or just the document IDs for a particular docset. \n",
    "6. Use the DocugamiLoader as detailed below, to get rich semantic chunks for your documents.\n",
    "7. Optionally, build and publish one or more [reports or abstracts](https://help.docugami.com/home/reports). This helps Docugami improve the semantic XML with better tags based on your preferences, which are then added to the DocugamiLoader output as metadata. Use techniques like [self-querying retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/self_query/) to do high accuracy Document QA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages vs Other Chunking Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Appropriate chunking of your documents is critical for retrieval from documents. Many chunking techniques exist, including simple ones that rely on whitespace and recursive chunk splitting based on character length. Docugami offers a different approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intelligent Chunking:** Docugami breaks down every document into a hierarchical semantic XML tree of chunks of varying sizes, from single words or numerical values to entire sections. These chunks follow the semantic contours of the document, providing a more meaningful representation than arbitrary length or simple whitespace-based chunking.\n",
    "2. **Structured Representation:** In addition, the XML tree indicates the structural contours of every document, using attributes denoting headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other common elements, and does that consistently across all supported document formats, such as scanned PDFs or DOCX files. It appropriately handles long-form document characteristics like page headers/footers or multi-column flows for clean text extraction.\n",
    "3. **Semantic Annotations:** Chunks are annotated with semantic tags that are coherent across the document set, facilitating consistent hierarchical queries across multiple documents, even if they are written and formatted differently. For example, in set of lease agreements, you can easily identify key provisions like the Landlord, Tenant, or Renewal Date, as well as more complex information such as the wording of any sub-lease provision or whether a specific jurisdiction has an exception section within a Termination Clause.\n",
    "4. **Additional Metadata:** Chunks are also annotated with additional metadata, if a user has been using Docugami. This additional metadata can be used for high-accuracy Document QA without context window restrictions. See detailed code walk-through below.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **id and source:** ID and Name of the file (PDF, DOC or DOCX) the chunk is sourced from within Docugami.\n",
    "2. **xpath:** XPath inside the XML representation of the document, for the chunk. Useful for source citations directly to the actual chunk inside the document XML.\n",
    "3. **structure:** Structural attributes of the chunk, e.g. h1, h2, div, table, td, etc. Useful to filter out certain kinds of chunks if needed by the caller.\n",
    "4. **tag:** Semantic tag for the chunk, using various generative and extractive techniques. More details here: https://github.com/docugami/DFM-benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "You can control chunking behavior by setting the following properties on the `DocugamiLoader` instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is a minimum chunk size of 32 that can be changed. Chunks smaller than the minimum size are appended to subsequent chunks. You can set `loader.min_chunk_size = 0` to get all structural chunks regardless of size or `loader.min_chunk_size = 1024` to get very large chunks.\n",
    "2. By default, only the text for chunks is returned. However, Docugami's XML knowledge graph has additional rich information including semantic tags for entities inside the chunk. Set `loader.include_xml_tags = True` if you want the additional xml metadata on the returned chunks. In addition, you can set `loader.xml_hierarchy_levels` if you want Docugami to return parent chunks in the documents it returns. This is useful e.g. with the [Parent Document Retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/parent_document_retriever)."

Should the transaction involving an assignment of Tenant\\'s interest under this Lease be a sale of multiple assets of Tenant, Landlord shall not be bound by any allocation of the purchase price for such assets which may be included in an agreement between Tenant and the transferee. Rather, the profit or gain on the transfer of Tenant\\'s interest under this Lease as defined in subsection (b) above shall be the fair market value of Tenant\\'s interest under this Lease as of the date of the transfer less the costs of the transaction as generally described above.

In addition, Landlord will use commercially reasonable, good-faith efforts to obtain a non-disturbance agreement from any future ground lessor or the holder of any mortgage granted as to the Project subsequent to the Date of this Lease, on the lessor’s or mortgagee’s then current standard form of agreement. “Commercially reasonable, good-faith efforts” of Landlord shall not require Landlord to incur any cost, expense, or liability to obtain a non-disturbance agreement and Tenant shall be responsible for any fees or costs charged by the lessor or mortgagee and mortgagee’s attorneys. Upon request of Landlord, Tenant will execute the lessor’s or mortgagee’s form of subordination, non-disturbance, and attornment agreement.

It is intended that the indemnitor indemnify the indemnitee, and its Parties against the consequences of their own negligence or fault, even when the indemnitee or its Parties is jointly, comparatively, contributively, or concurrently negligent with the indemnitor, and even though any such claim, cause of action, or suit is based upon or alleged to be based upon the strict liability of the indemnitee or its Parties, and the indemnitor waives and releases all claims against the indemnitee and its Parties for any claim covered by the indemnity obligations of the indemnitor under this article.

No waiver shall be effective unless expressed in writing and signed by the waiving party. No notice to or demand on a party shall of itself entitle the party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

Landlord may accept the check or payment without prejudice to Landlord\\'s right to recover the balance of the Rent or to pursue any other remedy.

The waiver of any noncompliance with this Lease shall not prevent subsequent similar noncompliance from being a default. No waiver shall be effective unless expressed in writing and signed by the waiving party. No notice to or demand on a party shall of itself entitle the party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. The receipt by Landlord of any Rent after default on the part of Tenant (whether the Rent is due before or after the default) shall not excuse any delays as to future Rent payments and shall not be deemed to operate as a waiver of any then-existing default by Tenant or of the right of Landlord to pursue any available remedies. No payment by Tenant, or receipt by Landlord, of a lesser amount than the Rent actually owed under the terms of this Lease shall be deemed to be anything other than a payment on account of the earliest stipulated Rent due. No endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment of Rent will be deemed an accord and satisfaction. Landlord may accept the check or payment without prejudice to Landlord's right to recover the balance of the Rent or to pursue any other remedy.

Tenant shall be responsible for repairs and maintenance to exit lighting, emergency lighting, and fire extinguishers for the Premises. Tenant is responsible for interior janitorial, pest control, and waste removal services. Landlord may at any time change the electrical utility provider for the Building. Tenant’s use of electrical, HVAC, or other services furnished by Landlord shall not exceed, either in voltage, rated capacity, use, or overall load, that which Landlord deems to be standard for the Building. In no event shall Landlord be liable for damages resulting from the failure to furnish any service, and any interruption or failure shall in no manner entitle Tenant to any remedies including abatement of Rent. If at any time during the Lease Term the Project has any type of card access system for the Parking Areas or the Building, Tenant shall purchase access cards for all occupants of the Premises from Landlord at a Building Standard charge and shall comply with Building Standard terms relating to access to the Parking Areas and the Building. </SERVICESANDUTILITIES></SERVICESANDUTILITIES-section> 22. <SECURITYDEPOSIT-section>SECURITY DEPOSIT. <SECURITYDEPOSIT>The Security Deposit shall be held by Landlord as security for Tenant's full and faithful performance of this Lease including the payment of Rent.

Any items of Tenant's property that shall remain in the Premises after the expiration or sooner termination of the Lease Term, may, at the option of Landlord and without notice, be deemed to have been abandoned, and in that case, those items may be retained by Landlord as its property to be disposed of by Landlord, without accountability or notice to Tenant or any other party, in the manner Landlord shall determine, at Tenant's expense. </ENDOFTERM></ENDOFTERM-section> 27. <ATTORNEYSFEES-section>ATTORNEYS' FEES. <ATTORNEYSFEES>Except as otherwise provided in this Lease, the prevailing party in any litigation or other dispute resolution proceeding, including arbitration, arising out of or in any manner based on or relating to this Lease, including tort actions and actions for injunctive, declaratory, and provisional relief, shall be entitled to recover from the losing party actual attorneys' fees and costs, including fees for litigating the entitlement to or amount of fees or costs owed under this provision, and fees in connection with bankruptcy, appellate, or collection proceedings. No person or entity other than Landlord or Tenant has any right to recover fees under this paragraph. In addition, if Landlord becomes a party to any suit or proceeding affecting the Premises or involving this Lease or Tenant's interest under this Lease, other than a suit between Landlord and Tenant, or if Landlord engages counsel to collect any of the amounts owed under this Lease, or to enforce performance of any of the agreements, conditions, covenants, provisions, or stipulations of this Lease, without commencing litigation, then the costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred by Landlord shall be paid to Landlord by Tenant. </ATTORNEYSFEES></ATTORNEYSFEES-section> 28. <NOTICES-section>NOTICES. <NOTICES>Any notice to be given under this Lease may be given either by a party itself or by its attorney or agent and shall be in writing and delivered by hand, by nationally recognized overnight air courier service (such as <OvernightAirCourierService>FedEx</OvernightAirCourierService>), or by the United States Postal <Org>Service</Org>, registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, in each case addressed to the respective party at the party's notice address. A notice shall be deemed effective upon receipt or the date sent if it is returned to the addressor because it is refused, unclaimed, or the addressee has moved. </NOTICES></NOTICES-section> 29. <EXCUSABLEDELAY-section>EXCUSABLE DELAY. <EXCUSABLEDELAY>For purposes of this Lease, the term \"Excusable Delay\" shall mean any delays resulting from causes beyond the direct control of the party delayed, including delays due to strikes, lockouts, riots, civil commotion, war (whether declared or undeclared) or warlike operations, acts of terrorism, cyber-attacks, acts of a public enemy, acts of bioterrorism, epidemics, pandemics, quarantines, or other health crises, invasion, rebellion, hostilities, military or usurped power, sabotage, government action, regulations or controls that are enacted after the Date of this Lease, inability to obtain any material, utility, or service because of governmental restrictions, inability to obtain building permits, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, or other natural disasters, or acts of God, power outages, or any other cause beyond the direct control of the party delayed, whether similar or dissimilar in kind and nature to any of the foregoing and whether foreseeable or unforeseeable. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, if Landlord or Tenant shall be delayed in the performance of any act required under this Lease by reason of any Excusable Delay, then provided notice of the Excusable Delay is given to the other party within <Notice>10 days </Notice>after its occurrence, performance of the act shall be excused for the period of the delay and the period for the performance of the act shall be extended for a reasonable period, in no event to exceed a period equivalent to the period of the delay. If a party fails to so notify the other party within any such ten-<TimeDuration>day </TimeDuration>period, such delay shall nevertheless be deemed an Excusable Delay from and after the date that the other party is notified of the delay. The provisions of this article shall not operate to excuse Tenant from the payment of Rent or from surrendering the Premises at the end of the Lease Term, or from the obligations to maintain insurance, and shall not operate to extend the Lease Term. Delays or failures to perform resulting from lack of funds or the increased cost of obtaining labor and materials shall not be deemed delays beyond the direct control of a party. </EXCUSABLEDELAY></EXCUSABLEDELAY-section> 30. <QUIETENJOYMENT-section>QUIET ENJOYMENT. <QUIETENJOYMENT>Landlord covenants and agrees that, on Tenant's paying rent and performing all of the other provisions of this Lease on its part to be performed, Tenant may peaceably and quietly hold and enjoy the Premises for the Lease Term without material hindrance or interruption by Landlord or any other person claiming by, through, or under Landlord, subject, nevertheless, to the terms, covenants, and conditions of this Lease and all existing or future ground leases, underlying leases, or mortgages encumbering the Project. </QUIETENJOYMENT></QUIETENJOYMENT-section> 31. RESERVED. 32. PARKING. Tenant shall be entitled to use no more than the number of parking spaces in the Parking Areas and on such terms as specified in the Basic Lease Information and Defined Terms article of this Lease. Additional Rent for parking spaces shall be as provided in the Basic Lease Information and Defined Terms article of this Lease and shall be due and payable, in advance, at the same time as monthly installments of Base Rent are due and payable under this Lease, plus all applicable sales taxes. Tenant shall pay for all such allocated spaces whether Tenant actually uses such spaces or not. The parking spaces may only be used by principals and employees of Tenant. \"Parking Areas\" shall mean the areas available for automobile parking in connection with the Building as those areas may be designated by Landlord <Frequency>from time to time</Frequency>.
