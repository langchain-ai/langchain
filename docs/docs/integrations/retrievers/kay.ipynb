      "**Answer**: In 2023, Roku made a strategic partnership with FreeWheel to bring Roku's leading ad tech to FreeWheel customers. This partnership aimed to drive greater interoperability and automation in the advertising-based video on demand (AVOD) space. Key highlights of this collaboration include streamlined integration of Roku's demand application programming interface (dAPI) with FreeWheel's TV platform, allowing for better inventory quality control and improved publisher yield and revenue. Additionally, publishers can now use Roku platform signals to enable advertisers to target audiences and measure campaign performance without relying on cookies. This partnership also involves the use of data clean room technology to enable the activation of additional data sets for better measurement and monetization for publishers and agencies. These partnerships and strategies aim to support Roku's growth in the AVOD market. \n",
