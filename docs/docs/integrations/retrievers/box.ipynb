    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BoxRetriever` class helps you get your unstructured content from Box in Langchain's `Document` format. You can do this by searching for files based on a full-text search or using Box AI to retrieve a `Document` containing the result of an AI query against files. This requires including a `List[str]` containing Box file ids, i.e. `[\"12345\",\"67890\"]` \n",

    "\n",
    "In order to use the Box package, you will need a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Box account — If you are not a current Box customer or want to test outside of your production Box instance, you can use a [free developer account](https://account.box.com/signup/n/developer#ty9l3).\n",
    "* [A Box app](https://developer.box.com/guides/getting-started/first-application/) — This is configured in the [developer console](https://account.box.com/developers/console), and for Box AI, must have the `Manage AI` scope enabled. Here you will also select your authentication method\n",
    "* The app must be [enabled by the administrator](https://developer.box.com/guides/authorization/custom-app-approval/#manual-approval). For free developer accounts, this is whomever signed up for the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "For these examples, we will use [token authentication](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/tokens/developer-tokens). This can be used with any [authentication method](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/). Just get the token with whatever methodology. If you want to learn more about how to use other authentication types with `langchain-box`, visit the [Box provider](/docs/integrations/providers/box) document."

They begin to \\ndance. No music can be heard. The sound of the girls\\' bodies \\nis our soundtrack. We hear their strained breathing, palms \\nand sneaker bottoms pounding while they hum and count softly \\nto themselves in an effort to keep the rhythm.\\n\\nSLO-MO: We explore the bodies of the dancers; their bright \\neyes and sweaty brows, their stomping feet and colliding \\nhands (dark side and light side). The younger girls perform \\nprovocative dance movements, the older girls repeat them.\\n\\nTheir bodies silhouette in the bright sunlight.\\n\\nCUT TO: TITLES\\n\\nEXT. AMANDA\\'S BLOCK - DAY \\n\\nAMANDA, a tall 14-year-old exits the front door of her \\napartment budding with her headphones in one hand and a \\nmagazine in the other. She sits down on her stoop, puts her \\nheadphones on and presses \"play\". We can hear the sound of \\nSalsa leaking out of the sides of her headphones. JENETTE, \\nten years old with big black hair in rubber-band restraints, sits on \\nthe sidewalk below Amanda drawing with a piece of chalk. Jenette \\n\\n        looks over her shoulder and sees Amanda reading her magazine Jenette \\nclimbs the stairs and sits down beside her.\\n\\nThe camera pans to reveal AARON, an 18-year-old boy on the \\nother side of the street, unloading some fireworks from the \\ntrunk of a car. He\\'s filling a paper bag with them, \\ncarefully making sure not to reveal what he\\'s doing to \\nonlookers.\\n\\nAt the ear end of the block, DONNA, 14, and MICHELLE, 12, \\nsit and watch Aaron at work.\\n\\n\\n\\n3/20/23, 5:31 PM FIVE FEET AND RISING by Peter Sollett\\n\\nwww.dailyscript.com/scripts/fivefeetandrising.html 2/25\\n\\nMICHELLE \\nHow does he look up close?\\n\\nDONNA \\n(Amorously) \\n\\nUmm, he got dark brownish \\neyes, he got a nice nose I \\nlove his nose. I love his \\nskin. I love his lips, he \\ngot a great smile and he \\ngot-\\n\\nMICHELLE \\nA bad attitude.\\n\\nDONNA \\nYeah, he got a bad \\nattitude.\\n\\nMICHELLE \\nYou said before, that he \\ngot boxes?\\n\\nSLO-MO: The camera is very close to Aaron. Details of his \\nbody in a shallow depth of field.\\n\\nDONNA \\nYeah, he got boxes in his \\nstomach. He\\'s taller than \\nme.\\n\\nMICHELLE \\nHow old is he?\\n\\nDONNA \\nI think he\\'s 18 or 17.\\n\\nMICHELLE \\nYou gonna talk to him?\\n\\nDONNA \\nUm, yeah I think so.\\n\\nBack on Amanda\\'s stoop.\\n\\nJENETTE \\nYou still like him.\\n\\nAMANDA \\n(With a sigh of negative attitude) \\n\\nNo.\\n\\nHECTOR, a mature-looking 13-year old is crossing the \\nstreet. He enters frame with Amanda and Jenette. \\n\\nHECTOR \\nYo, wuzzup. \\n\\nAmanda ignores him. \\n\\nJENETTE \\nHi Hector\\n\\nHECTOR \\n(To Amanda) \\n\\n\\n\\n3/20/23, 5:31 PM FIVE FEET AND RISING by Peter Sollett\\n\\nwww.dailyscript.com/scripts/fivefeetandrising.html 3/25\\n\\nOh, you\\'re not gonna say \\nhello.\\n\\nAMANDA\\'S POV: Donna approaches Aaron as he locks up the \\ntrunk of the car. She hesitantly calls over to him. He \\nacknowledges her with a lift of the chin. Making sure he \\nkeeps his distance from her, he looks around to see if \\nanyone is watching him. He tosses his head for her to \\nfollow. He begins to walk away down the block. She follows.\\n\\nHector is looking at Amanda. He appears to have run out of \\nthings to say. Amanda removes her headphones. Her music \\nbecomes clearer, more audible.\\n\\nHECTOR \\nYo, you gonna keep me \\nhangin\\' like dat?\\n\\nAMANDA \\nHector, Yo try to rap to me every day, why don\\'t you \\ntake your three-quarters retarded ass outta here?\\n\\nHECTOR \\nYo, you betta give me my \\nrespects or I\\'ll tell your \\nlittle girl ova here what \\nI heard about you and my \\nboy.\\n\\nAmanda puts her headphones back on.\\n\\nHECTOR looks like he got a new girl anyway.\\n\\nEXT. 8TH STREET BETWEEN AVENUES C AND D - AFTERNOON \\n\\nVICTOR, a skinny 12-year-old with sloppy hair, is asleep in \\nthe sun on his fire escape. There is sweat beaded up on his \\nbody. His shirt is rolled up behind his head like a pillow. \\nHis breath is heavy, his chest rises and falls. The camera \\ntilts to reveal CARLOS, ten, rounding the corner on the \\nstreet below. The camera tracks backwards as Carlos \\napproaches. He is talking to himself.\\n\\nCARLOS \\n(To himself) \\n\\nWhatcha gonna do when ya \\nbitch is untrue?\\n\\nCarlos lifts his head up to look at the fire escapes.\\n\\nCARLOS \\nYo Victor!\\n\\nThe camera pans and tilts up to the fire escapes. The \\nbuildings float by. He arrives in front of Victor\\'s \\nbuilding and cups his hand around his mouth.\\n\\nCARLOS \\nYo Victor!\\n\\nOn the fire escape, Victor\\'s eyes pop open and the sun \\nshines into them.\\n\\nVICTOR \\n(Dazed) \\n\\n\\n\\n3/20/23, 5:31 PM FIVE FEET AND RISING by Peter Sollett\\n\\nwww.dailyscript.com/scripts/fivefeetandrising.html 4/25\\n\\nWhat, wuzzup?\\n\\nVictor sits up and looks over the side of the fire escape.\\n\\nCARL0S \\nCome down!\\n\\nVICTOR \\nI can\\'t!\\n\\nCARLOS \\nWhy?\\n\\nVICTOR \\nI got punished, man.\\n\\nCARLOS \\nFa what?\\n\\nVICTOR \\nI won\\'t let my motha cut \\nmy hair.\\n\\nCARLOS \\nWha\\'?\\n\\nVICTOR \\nShe fucks it all up!\\n\\nCARLOS \\nForget it!

THE CORNER OF 8TH STREET AND AVENUE D - CONTINUOUS \\n\\nThe boys safely round the corner onto Avenue D. Victor \\nperks up and starts nudging Carlos.\\n\\nVICTOR \\nSo what girls are over \\nthere?\\n\\nCARLOS \\nNatasha, Maria, Tina-\\n\\nVICTOR \\nThese are the pretty girls \\nyou told me to come down \\nfor?\\n\\nVictor sighs and runs his fingers through his hair.\\n\\nCARLOS \\nWhat\\'s the difference, you \\nnever do anything anyway\\n\\nVictor makes a disagreeing gesture. Carlos drags Victor \\nDowntown.\\n\\nVICTOR \\nWhat are you going that \\nway for?\\n\\nCARLOS \\nI\\'m not goin\\' to 10th \\nStreet, people piss and \\nshit in that pool,\\n\\nVICTOR \\nWhere you goin\\'?\\n\\nCARLOS \\nPitt.\\n\\nVICTOR \\nOh man, what we gotta \\nleave ar\\' own neighborhood \\nfor?\\n\\nCARLOS \\nC\\'mon.\\n\\nVICTOR \\nMan, if I go down you\\'re \\ngoin\\' down with me.\\n\\nEXT. AVENUE D - CONTINUOUS \\n\\nMONTAGE: Victor and Carlos hang on each other as they walk down \\n        Avenue D towards the Pitt Street Pool. They pass by Victor brother, \\n        giving him an impromptu smack and then bang on a store window to wave \\n\\n\\n\\n3/20/23, 5:31 PM FIVE FEET AND RISING by Peter Sollett\\n\\nwww.dailyscript.com/scripts/fivefeetandrising.html 6/25\\n\\nhello to a friend.\\n\\nFrom Victor\\'s POV we work our way through a crowd of people \\nan cross 3rd Street. Victor looks back at the crowd with a \\nwatchful eye. The camera tracks along in the street as the \\nboys walk along the sidewalk. Victor looks up at a street \\nsign. It reads, \"Houston St.\" As the boys make their way \\nacross the wide intersection, the heat is slightly visible \\nas car exhaust fills the gridlocked lanes. Victor and \\nCarlos walk calmly, with space between them, making their \\nway towards the camera in a shallow depth of field as we \\nfollow focus on them.\\n\\nEXT. PITT STREET POOL - CONTINUOUS \\n\\nVictor and Carlos stand on line outside the pool gates. Police \\nexamine the boys as they slowly inch their way into the park.\\n\\nFrom Victor\\'s POV we see the expanse of the pool as he \\nenters the park.
