    "> [AskNews](https://asknews.app) infuses any LLM with the latest global news (or historical news), using a single natural language query. Specifically, AskNews is enriching over 300k articles per day by translating, summarizing, extracting entities, and indexing them into hot and cold vector databases. AskNews puts these vector databases on a low-latency endpoint for you. When you query AskNews, you get back a prompt-optimized string that contains all the most pertinent enrichments (e.g. entities, classifications, translation, summarization). This means that you do not need to manage your own news RAG, and you do not need to worry about how to properly convey news information in a condensed way to your LLM.\n",
    "> AskNews is also committed to transparency, which is why our coverage is monitored and diversified across hundreds of countries, 13 languages, and 50 thousand sources. If you'd like to track our source coverage, you can visit our [transparency dashboard](https://asknews.app/en/transparency).\n",

The decline was attributed to interest rates, which are expected to remain high for a longer period. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose to 4.44%, the highest level since 2007, which has a negative impact on stock prices. The high interest rates have also affected the technology sector, with companies such as Intel and Microsoft experiencing declines. The auto sector is also experiencing fluctuations, with General Motors and Ford experiencing declines. The labor market is also facing challenges, with workers demanding higher wages and benefits, which could lead to increased inflation. The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates high for a longer period, which could have a negative impact on the stock market. Some economists expect the Fed to raise interest rates again this year, which could lead to further declines in the stock market.\\nsource: ALYAUM Holding Group for Press\\npublished: May 12 2024 13:12\\nLocation: US\\nTechnology: S&P 500\\nQuantity: 9.94 points\\nNumber: 4320.06\\nProduct: 10-year Treasury notes\\nDate: 2007, this year\\nOrganization: General Motors, Fed, Intel, Ford, Microsoft, Federal Reserve\\nclassification: Finance\\nsentiment: -1', metadata={'title': 'الأسهم الأمريكية تتطلع لتعويض خسائرها بعد موجة تراجع كبيرة', 'source': 'https://www.alyaum.com/articles/6529353/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF/%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%87%D9%85/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%87%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%B9-%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%B6-%D8%AE%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AC%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%B9-%D9%83%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9', 'images': 'https://www.alyaum.com/uploads/images/2024/05/12/2312237.jpg'}),\n",

Despite April's contraction of around 5%, the stock market has behaved well this week, with most indices showing increases. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 have risen almost 2% after declines of around 5% in April, while the Nasdaq has increased by 1.4% after a decline of over 4% in April.
