    "This page covers how to use [RAGatouille](https://github.com/bclavie/RAGatouille) as a retriever in a LangChain chain. RAGatouille makes it as simple as can be to use ColBERT! [ColBERT](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT) is a fast and accurate retrieval model, enabling scalable BERT-based search over large text collections in tens of milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this as a [retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers). It will show functionality specific to this integration. After going through, it may be useful to explore [relevant use-case pages](/docs/use_cases/question_answering) to learn how to use this vectorstore as part of a larger chain.\n",
