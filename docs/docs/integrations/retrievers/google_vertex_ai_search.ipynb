    "[Vertex AI Search](https://cloud.google.com/enterprise-search) (formerly known as Enterprise Search on Generative AI App Builder) is a part of the [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) machine learning platform offered by Google Cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertex AI Search lets organizations quickly build generative AI powered search engines for customers and employees. It's underpinned by a variety of Google Search technologies, including semantic search, which helps deliver more relevant results than traditional keyword-based search techniques by using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to infer relationships within the content and intent from the user’s query input. Vertex AI Search also benefits from Google’s expertise in understanding how users search and factors in content relevance to order displayed results.\n",

    "Vertex AI Search is available in the Google Cloud Console and via an API for enterprise workflow integration.\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates how to configure Vertex AI Search and use the Vertex AI Search retriever. The Vertex AI Search retriever encapsulates the [Python client library](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/libraries#client-libraries-install-python) and uses it to access the [Search Service API](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/discoveryengine/latest/google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1beta.services.search_service).\n"

    "The Vertex AI Search retriever is implemented in the `langchain.retriever.GoogleVertexAISearchRetriever` class. The `get_relevant_documents` method returns a list of `langchain.schema.Document` documents where the `page_content` field of each document is populated the document content.\n",
    "Depending on the data type used in Vertex AI Search (website, structured or unstructured) the `page_content` field is populated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Website with advanced indexing: an `extractive answer` that matches a query. The `metadata` field is populated with metadata (if any) of the document from which the segments or answers were extracted.\n",
    "- Unstructured data source: either an `extractive segment` or an `extractive answer` that matches a query. The `metadata` field is populated with metadata (if any) of the document from which the segments or answers were extracted.\n",
    "- Structured data source: a string json containing all the fields returned from the structured data source. The `metadata` field is populated with metadata (if any) of the document\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extractive answers & extractive segments\n",
    "\n",
    "An extractive answer is verbatim text that is returned with each search result. It is extracted directly from the original document. Extractive answers are typically displayed near the top of web pages to provide an end user with a brief answer that is contextually relevant to their query. Extractive answers are available for website and unstructured search.\n",
    "\n",
    "An extractive segment is verbatim text that is returned with each search result. An extractive segment is usually more verbose than an extractive answer. Extractive segments can be displayed as an answer to a query, and can be used to perform post-processing tasks and as input for large language models to generate answers or new text. Extractive segments are available for unstructured search.\n",

    "For more information about extractive segments and extractive answers refer to [product documentation](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/snippets).\n",

    "NOTE: Extractive segments require the [Enterprise edition](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/about-advanced-features#enterprise-features) features to be enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating an instance of the retriever you can specify a number of parameters that control which data store to access and how a natural language query is processed, including configurations for extractive answers and segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The mandatory parameters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `project_id` - Your Google Cloud Project ID.\n",
    "- `location_id` - The location of the data store.\n",
    "  - `global` (default)\n",
    "  - `us`\n",
    "  - `eu`\n",
    "- `data_store_id` - The ID of the data store you want to use.\n",
    "  - Note: This was called `search_engine_id` in previous versions of the retriever.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `project_id` and `data_store_id` parameters can be provided explicitly in the retriever's constructor or through the environment variables - `PROJECT_ID` and `DATA_STORE_ID`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also configure a number of optional parameters, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_documents` - The maximum number of documents used to provide extractive segments or extractive answers\n",
    "- `get_extractive_answers` - By default, the retriever is configured to return extractive segments.\n",
    "  - Set this field to `True` to return extractive answers. This is used only when `engine_data_type` set to `0` (unstructured)\n",
    "- `max_extractive_answer_count` - The maximum number of extractive answers returned in each search result.\n",
    "  - At most 5 answers will be returned. This is used only when `engine_data_type` set to `0` (unstructured).\n",
    "- `max_extractive_segment_count` - The maximum number of extractive segments returned in each search result.\n",
    "  - Currently one segment will be returned. This is used only when `engine_data_type` set to `0` (unstructured).\n",
    "- `filter` - The filter expression for the search results based on the metadata associated with the documents in the data store.\n",
    "- `query_expansion_condition` - Specification to determine under which conditions query expansion should occur.\n",
    "  - `0` - Unspecified query expansion condition. In this case, server behavior defaults to disabled.\n",
    "  - `1` - Disabled query expansion. Only the exact search query is used, even if SearchResponse.total_size is zero.\n",
    "  - `2` - Automatic query expansion built by the Search API.\n",
    "- `engine_data_type` - Defines the Vertex AI Search data type\n",
    "  - `0` - Unstructured data\n",
    "  - `1` - Structured data\n",
    "  - `2` - Website data with [Advanced Website Indexing](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/about-advanced-features#advanced-website-indexing)\n",

    "\n",
    "In previous versions, this retriever was called `GoogleCloudEnterpriseSearchRetriever`. Some backwards-incompatible changes had to be made to the retriever after the General Availability launch due to changes in the product behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "To update to the new retriever, make the following changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change the import from: `from langchain.retrievers import GoogleCloudEnterpriseSearchRetriever` -> `from langchain.retrievers import GoogleVertexAISearchRetriever`.\n",
    "- Change all class references from `GoogleCloudEnterpriseSearchRetriever` -> `GoogleVertexAISearchRetriever`.\n",
    "- Upon class initialization, change the `search_engine_id` parameter name to `data_store_id`.\n"
