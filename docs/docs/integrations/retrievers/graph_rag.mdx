# Graph RAG

This guide provides an introduction to Graph RAG. For detailed documentation of all
supported features and configurations, refer to the
[Graph RAG Project Page](https://datastax.github.io/graph-rag/).

## Overview

The `GraphRetriever` from the `langchain-graph-retriever` package provides a LangChain
[retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers/) that combines **unstructured** similarity search
on vectors with **structured** traversal of metadata properties. This enables graph-based
retrieval over an **existing** vector store.

### Integration details

## Benefits

* [**Link based on existing metadata:**](https://datastax.github.io/graph-rag/guide/get-started/)
  Use existing metadata fields without additional processing. Retrieve more from an
  existing vector store!

* [**Change links on demand:**](https://datastax.github.io/graph-rag/guide/edges/)
  Edges can be specified on-the-fly, allowing different relationships to be traversed
  based on the question.


* [**Pluggable Traversal Strategies:**](https://datastax.github.io/graph-rag/guide/strategies/)
  Use built-in traversal strategies like Eager or MMR, or define custom logic to select
  which nodes to explore.

* [**Broad compatibility:**](https://datastax.github.io/graph-rag/guide/adapters/)
  Adapters are available for a variety of vector stores with support for additional
  stores easily added.

### Populating the Vector store

This section shows how to populate a variety of vector stores with the sample data.

For help on choosing one of the vector stores below, or to add support for your
vector store, consult the documentation about
[Adapters and Supported Stores](https://datastax.github.io/graph-rag/guide/adapters/).

<Tabs groupId="vector-store" queryString>
  <TabItem value="astra-db" label="AstraDB" default>
    <div style={{ paddingLeft: '30px' }}>
      Install the `langchain-graph-retriever` package with the `astra` extra:

      ```bash
      pip install "langchain-graph-retriever[astra]"
      ```

      Then create a vector store and load the test documents:

      ```python
      from langchain_astradb import AstraDBVectorStore

      vector_store = AstraDBVectorStore.from_documents(
          documents=animals,
          embedding=embeddings,
          collection_name="animals",
          api_endpoint=ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT,
          token=ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN,
      )
      ```
      For the `ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT` and `ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN` credentials,
      consult the [AstraDB Vector Store Guide](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/astradb).

      :::note
      For faster initial testing, consider using the **InMemory** Vector Store.

      ```

      Then create a vector store and load the test documents:

      ```python
      from langchain_community.vectorstores.cassandra import Cassandra
      from langchain_graph_retriever.transformers import ShreddingTransformer

      vector_store = Cassandra.from_documents(

      :::note
      Apache Cassandra doesn't support searching in nested metadata. Because of this
      it is necessary to use the [`ShreddingTransformer`](https://datastax.github.io/graph-rag/reference/langchain_graph_retriever/transformers/#langchain_graph_retriever.transformers.shredding.ShreddingTransformer)
      when inserting documents.

      Then create a vector store and load the test documents:

      ```python
      from langchain_chroma.vectorstores import Chroma
      from langchain_graph_retriever.transformers import ShreddingTransformer

      vector_store = Chroma.from_documents(

          embedding=embeddings,
      )
      ```

      :::tip
      Using the `InMemoryVectorStore` is the fastest way to get started with Graph RAG
      but it isn't recommended for production use. Instead it is recommended to use
      **AstraDB** or **OpenSearch**.

### Graph Traversal

This graph retriever starts with a single animal that best matches the query, then
traverses to other animals sharing the same `habitat` and/or `origin`.

  ```python
  from graph_retriever.strategies import Eager
  from langchain_graph_retriever import GraphRetriever

  traversal_retriever = GraphRetriever(
      store = vector_store,
      edges = [("habitat", "habitat"), ("origin", "origin")],
      strategy = Eager(k=5, start_k=1, max_depth=2),
  )
  ```

The above creates a graph traversing retriever that starts with the nearest
animal (`start_k=1`), retrieves 5 documents (`k=5`) and limits the search to documents
that are at most 2 steps away from the first animal (`max_depth=2`).

The `edges` define how metadata values can be used for traversal. In this case, every
animal is connected to other animals with the same `habitat` and/or `origin`.

```python
results = traversal_retriever.invoke("what animals could be found near a capybara?")

for doc in results:
    print(f"{doc.id}: {doc.page_content}")
```

```output
capybara: capybaras are the largest rodents in the world and are highly social animals.
heron: herons are wading birds known for their long legs and necks, often seen near water.
crocodile: crocodiles are large reptiles with powerful jaws and a long lifespan, often living over 70 years.
frog: frogs are amphibians known for their jumping ability and croaking sounds.
duck: ducks are waterfowl birds known for their webbed feet and quacking sounds.
```

Graph traversal improves retrieval quality by leveraging structured relationships in
the data. Unlike standard similarity search (see below), it provides a clear,
explainable rationale for why documents are selected.

In this case, the documents `capybara`, `heron`, `frog`, `crocodile`, and `newt` all
share the same `habitat=wetlands`, as defined by their metadata. This should increase
Document Relevance and the quality of the answer from the LLM.

### Comparison to Standard Retrieval

When `max_depth=0`, the graph traversing retriever behaves like a standard retriever:

```python
standard_retriever = GraphRetriever(
    store = vector_store,
    edges = [("habitat", "habitat"), ("origin", "origin")],
    strategy = Eager(k=5, start_k=5, max_depth=0),
)
```

This creates a retriever that starts with the nearest 5 animals (`start_k=5`),
and returns them without any traversal (`max_depth=0`). The edge definitions
are ignored in this case.

This is essentially the same as:

```python
standard_retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k":5})
```

For either case, invoking the retriever returns:

```python
results = standard_retriever.invoke("what animals could be found near a capybara?")

for doc in results:
    print(f"{doc.id}: {doc.page_content}")
```

```output
capybara: capybaras are the largest rodents in the world and are highly social animals.
iguana: iguanas are large herbivorous lizards often found basking in trees and near water.
guinea pig: guinea pigs are small rodents often kept as pets due to their gentle and social nature.
hippopotamus: hippopotamuses are large semi-aquatic mammals known for their massive size and territorial behavior.
boar: boars are wild relatives of pigs, known for their tough hides and tusks.
```

These documents are joined based on similarity alone. Any structural data that existed
in the store is ignored. As compared to graph retrieval, this can decrease Document
Relevance because the returned results have a lower chance of being helpful to answer
the query.

## Usage

Following the examples above, `.invoke` is used to initiate retrieval on a query.

## Use within a chain

Like other retrievers, `GraphRetriever` can be incorporated into LLM applications
via [chains](/docs/how_to/sequence/).

<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" />

```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
"""Answer the question based only on the context provided.

Context: {context}

Question: {question}"""
)

def format_docs(docs):
    return "\n\n".join(f"text: {doc.page_content} metadata: {doc.metadata}" for doc in docs)

chain = (
    {"context": traversal_retriever | format_docs, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)
```

```python
chain.invoke("what animals could be found near a capybara?")
```

```output
Animals that could be found near a capybara include herons, crocodiles, frogs,
and ducks, as they all inhabit wetlands.
```
