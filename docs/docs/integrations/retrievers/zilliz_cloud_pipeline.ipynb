       " Document(page_content='# Upsert Entities\\n## Flush data\\nWhen data is upserted into Milvus it is updated and inserted into segments. Segments have to reach a certain size to be sealed and indexed. Unsealed segments will be searched brute force. In order to avoid this with any remainder data, it is best to call flush(). The flush() call will seal any remaining segments and send them for indexing. It is important to only call this method at the end of an upsert session. Calling it too often will cause fragmented data that will need to be cleaned later on.\\\\\\n\\\\\\n# Upsert Entities\\n## Limits\\nUpdating primary key fields is not supported by upsert().\\nupsert() is not applicable and an error can occur if autoID is set to True for primary key fields.', metadata={'id': 448986959321277983, 'distance': 0.5672488212585449}),\n",
