       " Document(page_content='Quickstart\\n\\nIn this quickstart we\\'ll show you how to:\\n\\nGet setup with LangChain, LangSmith and LangServe\\n\\nUse the most basic and common components of LangChain: prompt templates, models, and output parsers\\n\\nUse LangChain Expression Language, the protocol that LangChain is built on and which facilitates component chaining\\n\\nBuild a simple application with LangChain\\n\\nTrace your application with LangSmith\\n\\nServe your application with LangServe\\n\\nThat\\'s a fair amount to cover! Let\\'s dive in.\\n\\nSetup\\n\\nInstallation\\n\\nTo install LangChain run:\\n\\nPip\\n\\nConda\\n\\npip install langchain\\n\\nFor more details, see our Installation guide.\\n\\nEnvironment\\n\\nUsing LangChain will usually require integrations with one or more model providers, data stores, APIs, etc. For this example, we\\'ll use OpenAI\\'s model APIs.\\n\\nFirst we\\'ll need to install their Python package:\\n\\npip install openai\\n\\nAccessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading here. Once we have a key we\\'ll want to set it as an environment variable by running:\\n\\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"...\"\\n\\nIf you\\'d prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the openai_api_key named parameter when initiating the OpenAI LLM class:\\n\\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\\n\\nllm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=\"...\")\\n\\nLangSmith\\n\\nMany of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with LangSmith.\\n\\nNote that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\\n\\nexport LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\" export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=...\\n\\nLangServe\\n\\nLangServe helps developers deploy LangChain chains as a REST API. You do not need to use LangServe to use LangChain, but in this guide we\\'ll show how you can deploy your app with LangServe.\\n\\nInstall with:\\n\\npip install \"langserve\\\\[all\\\\]\"\\n\\nBuilding with LangChain\\n\\nLangChain provides many modules that can be used to build language model applications. Modules can be used as standalones in simple applications and they can be composed for more complex use cases. Composition is powered by LangChain Expression Language (LCEL), which defines a unified Runnable interface that many modules implement, making it possible to seamlessly chain components.\\n\\nThe simplest and most common chain contains three things:\\n\\nLLM/Chat Model: The language model is the core reasoning engine here. In order to work with LangChain, you need to understand the different types of language models and how to work with them. Prompt Template: This provides instructions to the language model. This controls what the language model outputs, so understanding how to construct prompts and different prompting strategies is crucial. Output Parser: These translate the raw response from the language model to a more workable format, making it easy to use the output downstream. In this guide we\\'ll cover those three components individually, and then go over how to combine them. Understanding these concepts will set you up well for being able to use and customize LangChain applications. Most LangChain applications allow you to configure the model and/or the prompt, so knowing how to take advantage of this will be a big enabler.\\n\\nLLM / Chat Model\\n\\nThere are two types of language models:\\n\\nLLM: underlying model takes a string as input and returns a string\\n\\nChatModel: underlying model takes a list of messages as input and returns a message\\n\\nStrings are simple, but what exactly are messages? The base message interface is defined by BaseMessage, which has two required attributes:\\n\\ncontent: The content of the message. Usually a string. role: The entity from which the BaseMessage is coming.
