              "  'summary': \"The New York Mets are likely parting ways with star first baseman Pete Alonso after failing to finalize a contract agreement. Alonso rejected a last-minute three-year offer worth between $68 and $70 million, leading the Mets to redirect funds towards acquiring a top reliever. With Alonso's free-agent options dwindling, speculation arises about his potential signing with another team for the 2025 season, while the Mets plan to shift Mark Vientos to first base.\\n\\nIn a strategic move, the Mets are also considering a trade for Toronto Blue Jays' star first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. This potential acquisition aims to enhance the Mets' competitiveness as they reshape their roster. Guerrero's impressive offensive stats make him a valuable target, and discussions are in the early stages. Fans and analysts are keenly watching the situation, as a trade involving such a prominent player could significantly impact both teams.\",\n",
