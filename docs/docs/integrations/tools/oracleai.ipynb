    "# Oracle AI Vector Search: Generate Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Oracle AI Vector Search is designed for Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads that allows you to query data based on semantics, rather than keywords.\n",
    "One of the biggest benefits of Oracle AI Vector Search is that semantic search on unstructured data can be combined with relational search on business data in one single system.\n",
    "This is not only powerful but also significantly more effective because you don't need to add a specialized vector database, eliminating the pain of data fragmentation between multiple systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, your vectors can benefit from all of Oracle Database’s most powerful features, like the following:\n",

    "If you are just starting with Oracle Database, consider exploring the [free Oracle 23 AI](https://www.oracle.com/database/free/#resources) which provides a great introduction to setting up your database environment. While working with the database, it is often advisable to avoid using the system user by default; instead, you can create your own user for enhanced security and customization. For detailed steps on user creation, refer to our [end-to-end guide](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/cookbook/oracleai_demo.ipynb) which also shows how to set up a user in Oracle. Additionally, understanding user privileges is crucial for managing database security effectively. You can learn more about this topic in the official [Oracle guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/admqs/administering-user-accounts-and-security.html#GUID-36B21D72-1BBB-46C9-A0C9-F0D2A8591B8D) on administering user accounts and security."

This mode does not need Oracle Client libraries. However, some additional functionality is available when python-oracledb uses them. Python-oracledb is said to be in ‘Thick’ mode when Oracle Client libraries are used. Both modes have comprehensive functionality supporting the Python Database API v2.0 Specification. See the following [guide](https://python-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/appendix_a.html#featuresummary) that talks about features supported in each mode. You might want to switch to thick-mode if you are unable to use thin-mode."

It supports multiple summarization providers such as Database, OCIGENAI, HuggingFace, among others, allowing users to select the provider that best meets their needs. To utilize these capabilities, users must configure the summary parameters as specified. For detailed information on these parameters, please consult the [Oracle AI Vector Search Guide book](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/arpls/dbms_vector_chain1.html#GUID-EC9DDB58-6A15-4B36-BA66-ECBA20D2CE57)."
