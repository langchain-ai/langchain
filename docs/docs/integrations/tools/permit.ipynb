    "# Permit Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools integrate [Permit.io](https://www.permit.io/) with LangChain to handle two critical security needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **JWT Validation Tool** (`LangchainJWTValidationTool`):  \n",
    "   Validates a JWT token by fetching the correct public key from a JWKS endpoint and returning the token’s claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Authorization Tool** (`LangchainPermitTool`):  \n",
    "   Checks whether a user (identified by ID) has permission to perform a specific action on a resource in Permit.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining both tools, you can securely **authenticate** and **authorize** users or agents within LangChain workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Get\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Authentication via JWT**  \n",
    "  Verifies token signatures against public JWKs, extracts user claims, and ensures only valid tokens proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fine-Grained Authorization**  \n",
    "  Uses Permit.io’s API to check if a given user is allowed to perform an action on a resource, enforcing permissions within your LangChain flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Features\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tool Name                   | Purpose                                             | Returns                  |\n",

    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install the Integration**  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install langchain-permit\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PERMIT_API_KEY** – Required for the Permit authorization tool.  \n",
    "- *(Optional)* Provide a **JWKS_URL** or pass one at runtime for JWT validation if you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on setting up a Permit project or obtaining your `PERMIT_API_KEY`, see [Permit.io Documentation](https://docs.permit.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on which tool you use, you may need additional credentials or configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "### For LangchainJWTValidationTool\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **JWKS endpoint** that publishes your public keys in JSON Web Key Set format.  \n",
    "- The tool dynamically fetches the public key by matching the `kid` in the JWT’s header.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For LangchainPermitTool\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PERMIT_API_KEY** must be set in your environment or passed in as part of the tool’s initialization.  \n",
    "- Permit’s dashboard defines which actions and resources are allowed for each user, role, or group.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instantiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is how to instantiate each tool in Python. Typically, you’ll import them from the `langchain_permit.tools` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_permit.tools import LangchainJWTValidationTool, LangchainPermitTool\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize JWT validation tool (default approach)\n",
    "jwt_tool = LangchainJWTValidationTool()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize Permit-based authorization tool\n",
    "permit_tool = LangchainPermitTool()\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, these will look for environment variables (PERMIT_API_KEY, etc.). However, you can also pass parameters (like a custom Permit client or specific JWKS URL) to the constructor if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Invocation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Invoke Directly with Args\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call each tool’s `.run()` method (sync) or `.arun()` method (async) directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Validate JWT\n",
    "jwt_token = \"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...\"\n",
    "claims = jwt_tool.run(jwt_token=jwt_token, jwks_url=\"https://example.com/.well-known/jwks.json\")\n",
    "print(\"Decoded Claims:\", claims)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Check Permit-based Authorization\n",
    "user_id = claims.get(\"sub\")  # or any claim storing the user ID\n",
    "action = \"read\"\n",
    "resource = \"document\"\n",
    "\n",
    "allowed = permit_tool.run(user=user_id, action=action, resource=resource)\n",
    "print(\"Is user allowed?\", allowed)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If allowed is True, the user can proceed. Otherwise, you can deny the request or take another action.\n"
