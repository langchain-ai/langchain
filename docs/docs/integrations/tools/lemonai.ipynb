    "\n",
    ">[Lemon Agent](https://github.com/felixbrock/lemon-agent) helps you build powerful AI assistants in minutes and automate workflows by allowing for accurate and reliable read and write operations in tools like `Airtable`, `Hubspot`, `Discord`, `Notion`, `Slack` and `Github`.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [full docs here](https://github.com/felixbrock/lemonai-py-client).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most connectors available today are focused on read-only operations, limiting the potential of LLMs. Agents, on the other hand, have a tendency to hallucinate from time to time due to missing context or instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With `Lemon AI`, it is possible to give your agents access to well-defined APIs for reliable read and write operations. In addition, `Lemon AI` functions allow you to further reduce the risk of hallucinations by providing a way to statically define workflows that the model can rely on in case of uncertainty."
