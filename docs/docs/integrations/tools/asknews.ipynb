Specifically, AskNews is enriching over 300k articles per day by translating, summarizing, extracting entities, and indexing them into hot and cold vector databases. AskNews puts these vector databases on a low-latency endpoint for you. When you query AskNews, you get back a prompt-optimized string that contains all the most pertinent enrichments (e.g. entities, classifications, translation, summarization). This means that you do not need to manage your own news RAG, and you do not need to worry about how to properly convey news information in a condensed way to your LLM.\n",

The data on Wednesday showed a cooling of consumer price inflation in the US, leading markets to predict at least two rate cuts this year. However, enthusiasm was short-lived as another report indicated that the US labor market remains tight, and central banks remain cautious about inflation. The variable income continues to point to gains this week, but recedes after these figures.

Despite mixed economic signals, the Fed is expected to cut rates, with some predicting a cut in July and others in November. However, the author of the article is skeptical, citing the robust economy, healthy job market, and low inflation as reasons why rate cuts are not necessary. The article also discusses the technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which suggests that the market is overbought and may be due for a correction. The author advises investors to be patient and not get caught up in the excitement of breaking a big round number like 40,000, and to focus on the fundamentals of the market.\\nsource: FXStreet\\npublished: May 17 2024 10:44\\nNumber: 40,000\\nOrganization: Fed, Federal Reserve\\nDate: 2024, November, July\\nPerson: author\\nScience: RSI, Relative Strength Index\\nclassification: Finance\\nsentiment: 0\\n</doc>\\n\\n<doc>\\n[8]:\\ntitle: Global Markets Follow Mixed Trend as Fed Officials' Cautious Stance Continues\\nsummary: Global markets are following a mixed trend, with the Federal Reserve (Fed) officials' cautious stance and mixed signals from the data. While the inflation concerns have decreased significantly, the central banks' future steps are still being priced in. The Fed's 74% chance of cutting interest rates in September has decreased to 68% after the latest inflation data. The New York Fed President John Williams said that the slowing down of inflation is a positive sign, but it is not enough to prompt the Fed to cut interest rates soon. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin emphasized the need to keep interest rates high to combat high service sector prices and slow down the economy. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said that keeping interest rates at current levels will help to bring inflation down to 2%. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic advised patience and caution, suggesting that cutting interest rates might be suitable towards the end of the year. The US labor market data showed that the number of people applying for unemployment benefits decreased by 222,000, while the number of new home construction permits increased by 1.36 million. The 10-year Treasury yield rose by 2 basis points to 4.38%, while the gold price fell by 0.4% to $2,377. The Brent crude oil price rose by 0.1% to $83.3, and the copper price fell by 5 dollars to $4.92. The Nasdaq index fell by 0.26%, the Dow Jones index fell by 0.10%, and the S&P 500 index fell by 0.21%. The European markets were mixed, with the DAX 40 index rising by 0.69%, the FTSE 100 index rising by 0.08%, and the CAC 40 index rising by 0.63%. The Italian MIB 30 index fell by 0.12%. The Asian markets were mixed, with the Shanghai composite index rising by 0.2%, the Hang Seng index rising by 0.4%, and the Nikkei 225 index falling by 0.5%. The Turkish BIST 100 index rose by 1.59% to 10,319.96.\\nsource: Haberler.com\\npublished: May 17 2024 06:17\\nOrganization: Richmond Fed, Federal Reserve, Nasdaq, 10-year Treasury, Atlanta Fed, Fed, Dow Jones, Cleveland Fed\\nDate: September\\nPerson: Thomas Barkin, John Williams, Loretta Mester, Raphael Bostic\\nLocation: US\\nNumber: 222,000, 1.36 million\\nMoney: $2,377, $4.92, $83.3, 5 dollars\\nclassification: Business\\nsentiment: 0\\n</doc>\\n\\n<doc>\\n[9]:\\ntitle: Federal Reserve's Interest Rate Decision and the Impact on the Global Economy\\nsummary: The factors affecting the value of the US dollar, which is the world's most widely used currency, are numerous. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions, made every six weeks, are a significant factor. The recent inflation data was lower than expected, and this has increased the likelihood of two interest rate cuts by the Fed in the remaining part of the year. The increase in risk appetite has led to new record highs in US indexes and significant increases in precious metals such as gold. The rally in cryptocurrencies, led by Bitcoin, has also been observed. However, the key point is that the Fed's inflation target is 2%, and the current inflation rate of 3.5% is not expected to reach this level this year. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index also indicates that long-term inflation expectations will not reach 2%. Therefore, if the Fed insists on reaching its inflation target, it may create a more difficult problem, such as recession. The article also mentions that inflation is not only affecting the US, but almost every country in the world, and the IMF President has also made a statement about the possibility of interest rate cuts. The FAO has reported a decline in food prices for over a year, and the topic of interest rate cuts and which country and currency will be affected will continue to be on the agenda.\\nsource: Dünya\\npublished: May 17 2024 00:00\\nMoney: Bitcoin, gold, US dollar\\nOrganization: Federal Reserve, IMF, FAO, University of Michigan, Fed\\nLocation: US\\nPerson: President\\nclassification: Finance\\nsentiment: 0\\n</doc>\\n\\n<doc>\\n[10]:\\ntitle: US futures flat as Fed comments cool rate cut optimism\\nsummary: US stock index futures remained flat on Thursday evening, following a weak finish on Wall Street, as Federal Reserve officials warned that bets on interest rate cuts were potentially premature. The Fed officials, including Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, New York Fed President John Williams, and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, stated that the central bank still needed more confidence to cut interest rates, and that the timing of the move remained uncertain. As a result, investors slightly trimmed their expectations for a September rate cut, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes fell 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.
