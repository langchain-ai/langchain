    "# PlayWright Browser Toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    ">[Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) is an open-source automation tool developed by `Microsoft` that allows you to programmatically control and automate web browsers. It is designed for end-to-end testing, scraping, and automating tasks across various web browsers such as `Chromium`, `Firefox`, and `WebKit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This toolkit is used to interact with the browser. While other tools (like the `Requests` tools) are fine for static sites, `PlayWright Browser` toolkits let your agent navigate the web and interact with dynamically rendered sites. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some tools bundled within the `PlayWright Browser` toolkit include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `NavigateTool` (navigate_browser) - navigate to a URL\n",
    "- `NavigateBackTool` (previous_page) - wait for an element to appear\n",
    "- `ClickTool` (click_element) - click on an element (specified by selector)\n",
    "- `ExtractTextTool` (extract_text) - use beautiful soup to extract text from the current web page\n",
    "- `ExtractHyperlinksTool` (extract_hyperlinks) - use beautiful soup to extract hyperlinks from the current web page\n",
    "- `GetElementsTool` (get_elements) - select elements by CSS selector\n",
    "- `CurrentPageTool` (current_page) - get the current page URL\n"
