      " 1970 NBA championship \n",
      " The Knicks went 60-22 during the 1969-70 regular season, which is still tied for their best regular season record in franchise history. They were led by Willis Reed, who was named the NBA MVP after averaging 21.7 points and 13.9 rebounds during the campaign. Walt Frazier also had an excellent campaign, averaging 20.9 points, 6.0 rebounds and 8.2 assists. That helped him finish fourth in MVP voting. Reed, Frazier and Dave DeBusschere were all named All-Stars. \n",
      " In the 1970 Eastern Division semifinals, the Knicks defeated the Baltimore Bullets in seven games. They then defeated the Bucks in the Eastern Division Finals in five games. The NBA Finals against the Lakers proved to be a back-and-forth battle in which neither team won consecutive games. In the end, the Knicks prevailed in seven games. Reed was named Finals MVP and averaged 23.7 points, 13.8 rebounds and 2.8 assists across 18 playoff games. Over 19 playoff games, Frazier averaged 16.0 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists. \n",

He averaged 21.1 points, 7.3 rebounds and 5.9 assists per game. Reed appeared in 69 games but averaged just 11.0 points and 8.6 rebounds. What helped make up for Reed’s lack of scoring was that DeBusschere, Bill Bradley and Earl Monroe all averaged at least 15.5 points per game. \n",

      "Text: When did the New York Knicks last win the NBA Championship? The New York Knicks have not won the NBA Championship since 1973, when they were 4-1 series winners against the Los Angeles Lakers. They are into their first Eastern Conference final for 25 years after a 4-2 series win over defending champions the Boston Celtics. The Knicks wrapped up the series with one match to spare thanks to a 119-81 win at Madison Square Garden. The two-time champions will face the Indiana Pacers in the Conference finals, with the winner meeting either the Minnesota Timberwolves or Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Finals. OG Anunoby - one of two British players currently in the NBA - is among the Knicks' star players and started in all 86 of his appearances this season. Get in touch Is a 62-year wait coming to an end? While the Knicks are among the most recognised and popular NBA franchises, their quest for a third NBA finals title has lasted more than six decades. The Knicks have since featured in the 1994 and 1999 NBA finals, but were beaten by the Houston Rockets and San Antonio Spurs respectively. In four of the past five seasons, the Knicks have made the play-offs but lost in the Conference semi-finals. But in seven of the eight seasons between 2014-15 and 2021-22, they finished in the bottom five of the Eastern Conference. The Knicks' two NBA Finals wins were in 1970 and 1973. They also have four Conference and eight Division titles to their name. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, OG Anunoby of the New York Knicks is one of two British players in the NBA 'The Knicks' transformation is no accident' - analysis Sam Harris BBC Sport Journalist The New York Knicks' transformation into a legitimate Eastern Conference powerhouse is no accident - it's the product of astute front-office moves and a culture built on chemistry and grit. One of those big front-office moves came with the acquisition of Karl-Anthony Towns in late 2024. It was a trade that gave New York a true star in the frontcourt. Towns' inside-out scoring and rebounding dominance reshaped the Knicks' offense. But the most impactful upgrade might have been the addition of Mikal Bridges, who joined a familiar core of players forged from other Villanova college graduates Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart. That shared collegiate bond has produced a unique synergy that few teams can match. The result? A roster that defends as one, moves the ball instinctively, and embraces the moment. Leading it all is Jalen Brunson, whose rise from steady floor general to bona fide star has been nothing short of spectacular. Fresh from being named the NBA's Clutch Player of the Year, Brunson has delivered time and again in the postseason, nowhere more dramatically than in Game 4 against Boston, where his 39-point masterpiece powered a statement comeback win. He's the heartbeat of a Knicks team. Combined together it could be the case that after decades of searching, New York might finally have found the formula, not just for relevance, but for real contention.

      "Text: The New York Knicks are one of the premier franchises in the history of the NBA, despite the fact that they have not had anywhere near the championship success as teams like the Boston Celtics or Los Angeles Lakers. The Knicks have not won an NBA championship since 1973. The 52 ensuing seasons since that title represent one of the longest droughts in the NBA, ranking behind the Sacramento Kings, Atlanta Hawks, Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Clippers. And it's probably felt just as long since their last trip to the NBA Finals. The last title for the orange and blue came in 1973. The Knicks joined the NBA in 1949. Led by Hall of Famers Dick McGuire and Harry Gallatin, they lost three straight NBA Finals from 1951 to 1953 losing to George Mikan's Minneapolis Lakers twice. In 1951 they lost to a Rochester Royals team that was led by Hall of Famers Arnie Risen and Bob Davies. The Royals also featured a point guard named Red Holzman. Holzman would eventually make the Hall of Fame himself after turning the Knicks into contenders in the late 1960s as their head coach. The Knicks won their first championship in the 1970 NBA Finals. After missing Game 6 of the series with an injury, Willis Reed helped will his team to a victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 7, hitting his first two shots of the game. Three years later the Knicks won again in a Finals rematch against the Lakers. Led by Holzman, Reed, Walt Frazier and future New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, the Knicks beat Jerry West and the Lakers in five games. The Knicks have not won a title since that era. The Knicks haven't been to the NBA Finals since 1999. They also haven't been to the conference finals since 2000 when they lost to the Indiana Pacers, Reggie Miller, Jalen Rose and head coach Larry Bird. Having not been to the conference finals in a quarter century, they own the longest drought in the NBA behind the Washington Wizards (46 years) and Charlotte Hornets, a franchise that has never been in 37 years. The Knicks' last NBA Finals appearance was in the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season. The Knicks went 27–23 and finished one game ahead of the Charlotte Hornets for the No. 8 seed in the Eastern Conference. That Knicks team was led by Latrell Sprewell, Allan Houston, Patrick Ewing and Larry Johnson. Ewing went down with an injury during the conference finals and the team advanced to the Finals for the first time since drafting him and the Ewing Theory was born. It's also worth mentioning that second-year guard Rick Brunson appeared in nine games during New York's last Finals run. His son, Jalen, was 2 years old at the time. The Knicks have played in eight NBA Finals, winning two. Those two titles tie New York with the Houston Rockets and Milwaukee Bucks for the ninth most all time.

      " New York City is beginning to feel like the center of the professional basketball world again. Months after the WNBA's Liberty won their first-ever title, the NBA's Knicks have snapped a decades-long Eastern Conference Finals drought to move within four wins of a Finals appearance and eight wins of a title. Fans in the Mecca of basketball have responded accordingly. Despite the drought, the Knicks are undeniably one of the most storied franchises in professional sports. With some of the greatest players in league history suiting up in orange and blue, New York has experienced some large-scale success, though it has been over 50 years since the franchise was the last one standing. 📲  Follow The Sporting News on WhatsApp With that in mind, The Sporting News revisits the Knicks' last NBA championship and the team's history in the NBA Finals. NBA PLAYOFFS HQ:   Live NBA scores  |  NBA playoff schedule  |  NBA playoff bracket When was the last time the Knicks won an NBA championship? The last time the Knicks won an NBA championship was in 1973. New York needed five games to defeat the Lakers on the game's biggest stage for the second time in four seasons. The 1973 Knicks team was a who's who of all-time greats, featuring five members of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team: Dave DeBusschere, Walt Frazier, Jerry Lucas, Earl Monroe, and Willis Reed. Reed was named Finals MVP with averages of 16.4 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.6 assists in the series, while Hall of Famer Bill Bradley led the team with 18.6 points per game in the series. In many ways, the 1972-73 Knicks felt like a team of destiny, surging their way through the playoffs with a 4-1 semifinals victory over the 52-win Baltimore Bullets (now Wizards) and a seven-game East Finals win over the 1-seed Celtics, who had won 68 games during the regular season. MORE:  Where Willis Reed's 1970 heroics rank among gutsiest performances in playoff history How many NBA championships have the Knicks won? The Knicks have won two championships in franchise history — both championship wins came in the 1970s. As one of the NBA's original franchises, the 1946-47 season was New York's first. After three consecutive Finals losses in the 1950s, the franchise finally got over the hump with a seven-game series win over the Lakers in the 1970 NBA Finals. Three years later, the Knicks' championship core remained largely intact when they needed just five games to defeat the Lakers in the 1973 Finals.

      "> Abstract:Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) have triggered surges in market valuations for AI-related companies, often outpacing the realization of underlying capabilities. We examine the anchoring effect of AI capabilities on equity valuations and propose a Capability Realization Rate (CRR) model to quantify the gap between AI potential and realized performance. Using data from the 2023--2025 generative AI boom, we analyze sector-level sensitivity and conduct case studies (OpenAI, Adobe, NVIDIA, Meta, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs) to illustrate patterns of valuation premium and misalignment. Our findings indicate that AI-native firms commanded outsized valuation premiums anchored to future potential, while traditional companies integrating AI experienced re-ratings subject to proof of tangible returns. We argue that CRR can help identify valuation misalignment risk-where market prices diverge from realized AI-driven value. We conclude with policy recommendations to improve transparency, mitigate speculative bubbles, and align AI innovation with sustainable market value.\n",

      "> Abstract:Economic inequality is a global challenge, intensifying disparities in education, healthcare, and social stability. Traditional systems like the U.S. federal income tax reduce inequality but lack adaptability. Although models like the Saez Optimal Taxation adjust dynamically, they fail to address taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. This study introduces TaxAgent, a novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) to design adaptive tax policies. In our macroeconomic simulation, heterogeneous H-Agents (households) simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors while the TaxAgent (government) utilizes LLMs to iteratively optimize tax rates, balancing equity and productivity. Benchmarked against Saez Optimal Taxation, U.S. federal income taxes, and free markets, TaxAgent achieves superior equity-efficiency trade-offs. This research offers a novel taxation solution and a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation.\n",

      "> Abstract:The rapid rise of AI-based autonomous agents is transforming human society and economic systems, as these entities increasingly exhibit human-like or superhuman intelligence. From excelling at complex games like Go to tackling diverse general-purpose tasks with large language and multimodal models, AI agents are evolving from specialized tools into dynamic participants in social and economic ecosystems. Their autonomy and decision-making capabilities are poised to impact industries, professions, and human lives profoundly, raising critical questions about their integration into economic activities, potential ethical concerns, and the balance between their utility and safety.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> To address these challenges, this paper presents ten principles of AI agent economics, offering a framework to understand how AI agents make decisions, influence social interactions, and participate in the broader economy. Drawing on economics, decision theory, and ethics, we explore fundamental questions, such as whether AI agents might evolve from tools into independent entities, their impact on labor markets, and the ethical safeguards needed to align them with human values. These principles build on existing economic theories while accounting for the unique traits of AI agents, providing a roadmap for their responsible integration into human systems.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> Beyond theoretical insights, this paper highlights the urgency of future research into AI trustworthiness, ethical guidelines, and regulatory oversight. As we enter a transformative era, this work serves as both a guide and a call to action, ensuring AI agents contribute positively to human progress while addressing risks tied to their unprecedented capabilities.\n",

Paris has the world's largest museum and the most famous portrait!\\n\\nThe Louvre, a museum and art gallery in Paris, is the largest museum on earth with nearly 73,000 square metres of exhibition space - that’s more than the size of ten football pitches!\\n\\nThe Louvre was originally built in 1546 as a palace for the French royal family. The first resident of the palace was King Francis I. Francis, a lover of art, intended the Louvre to showcase his collection. Subsequent kings including Louis XIII and Louis XIV greatly expanded the crown's art holdings, with Louis XIV even acquiring the art collection of English king Charles I, after his execution in the [English Civil War](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zk4cwmn).\\n\\nThe collection remained mainly private until the outbreak of the [French Revolution](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/z4xx2v4) in 1789, and in 1793 the Louvre opened as a public art gallery. The first exhibition contained just 537 paintings, while today the museum displays more than 35,000 works of art. That means if you spent just 30 seconds looking at each piece, you would be in the museum for more than 200 days.\\n\\nArguably the most famous artwork housed within the gallery is the Mona Lisa ( _La Gioconda_ in Italian), painted by Leonardo da Vinci sometime between 1503 and 1519. The painting depicts a woman in a half-body portrait with the sitter’s position mostly turned toward the viewer, a groundbreaking idea at the time.\\n\\nKing Francis I, whom we met earlier, acquired the work after da Vinci’s death. It remained in the royal collection until the French Revolution. Following a brief period hanging in Napoleon’s bedroom, the Mona Lisa was installed in the Louvre Museum at the beginning of the 19th century.\\n\\nShe didn’t live there peacefully ever after. In 1911 the Mona Lisa was stolen. People flocked to the Louvre to view the empty space where the painting had once hung. Several people were arrested in connection with the theft, including famous artist [Pablo Picasso](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zw6sr82/watch/ztgcjxs). Two years later the painting was found stashed in the false bottom of a trunk belonging to Vincenzo Peruggia, a glass fitter who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a selection of paintings, including the Mona Lisa. Peruggia was arrested and the Mona Lisa took a tour of Italy before making its return to France.\\n\\nDuring World War II the Mona Lisa was selected as one of the most vulnerable artworks for enemy capture and was evacuated to numerous locations in the French countryside, eventually returning in 1945 once peace had been declared. Since then, she has mostly remained within the gallery, aside for a few quick trips abroad including New York, Washington, Moscow, and Tokyo.\\n\\nToday, more than 30,000 people view the painting each day the gallery is open.\\n\\n### 2\\\\. Why is Paris known as The City of Light?\\n\\nIt might not be for the reasons you think…\\n\\nIn the early 19th century, Paris became the first city in Europe to use gas lighting to illuminate its streets, thus earning its name as the City of Light. However, that’s not the only reason Paris earned this nickname…\\n\\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries an intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment became popular within the western world. The key idea behind the movement was the use and celebration of reason, with the core goals for humankind being knowledge, freedom, and happiness. Important figures of the movement included Francis Bacon and Benjamin Franklin.\\n\\nBut what was the key location for the great change in how humanity thought about the world? Paris, of course! The cafés and coffeehouses of 18th century Paris provided a place for intellectual conversations where philosophers developed new ideas and theories.\\n\\nTo put it simply, Age of En **light** enment + Paris = The City of Light.\\n\\n### 3\\\\. The first commercial screening of a projected film...\\n\\n…happened in Paris.\\n\\nIn the late 19th century, the race to develop technology for capturing and displaying [moving pictures](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/subjects/z9c6y4j) was well underway. The two countries leading the charge were France and the USA.\\n\\nAmerican Thomas Edison and his modestly self-titled Edison company were the first to produce a moving picture for the masses – well, masses of one. His device, the Kinetoscope, enabled one person at a time to view moving pictures.\\n\\nImage caption,\\n\\nThomas Edison’s Kinetoscope\\n\\nBut the first people to present _projected_ moving pictures to a paying audience, in anything like the cinemas we have today, were the Lumière brothers in December 1895 in Paris, France. The device they developed and used was called the _Cinématographe_; it was a camera, a projector and a film printer all in one.\\n\\nUnlike the electrically powered Kinetograph camera, which was used to create the film for Edison’s Kinetoscope, the _Cinématographe_ was hand-cranked so films could be shot anywhere - in the middle of bustling cities or deep in the wilderness, sometimes even from moving vehicles. This portability meant the technology quickly caught on and the Lumières swiftly established agencies in many countries - but the place where it all began was the _Salon Indien du Grand Café_ in Paris.\\n\\n### 4\\\\. There are Statues of Liberty dotted all over Paris\\n\\nFew things are more American than the Statue of Liberty, right?\\n\\nWell, not quite: the familiar 93-metre monument that lives in New York City was originally a gift from the people of France to commemorate the friendship between their countries.\\n\\nThe statue is made from copper sheets, bent into shape using hammers and pieced together over an enormous structure of steel supports. The completed statue was presented to the American minister to France in Paris on 4th July, 1884. In 1885 the statue was disassembled and shipped to New York City.\\n\\nWith one [famous statue](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zffsn9q) shipped across the Atlantic, many more popped up to fill her place. Today there are several replicas of the statue located all over Paris, the largest on a small man-made island on the river Seine called Île aux Cygnes. This smaller replica, standing 11.5 metres tall, was actually a gift from America to France in return for their previous statue-based generosity. Nice!\\n\\n### 5\\\\. Paris is the second city to have hosted three summer Olympic Games\\n\\nParis previously hosted the Olympic Games in 1900 and 1924. 2024 is the year it joins London in the exclusive club of three-time Olympics hosts.\\n\\nQuite a bit has changed in the 100 years since Paris last hosted the games. Back then, only 44 countries took part and events included competitive architecture and painting! There was also a music competition, but sadly no medals were awarded. Another anomaly is that no gold medal was awarded for the architecture competition, despite silver and bronze going to Hungary and Monaco respectively.\\n\\nThe 1924 games were also the first to feature a closing ceremony in the form that we know it today, and the first to feature an Olympic village to accommodate the athletes taking part.\\n\\nJump forward to 2024, and over 200 countries now compete in events including the new addition of break dancing, or breaking. Although, sadly, there will be no painting or architecture events in this edition…\\n\\n## Where can I find out more about France?\\n\\nIf these Parisian facts have whetted your appetite for all things French, you may enjoy heading to our [KS2](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/z74gcqt/articles/zyvnm39) and [KS3 French games](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zrrfscw/articles/zjpfbwx).\\n\\nIf you're more interested in the culture, then check out [festivals and customs](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/z7rf382) throughout the French-speaking world.\"), Document(metadata={'title': 'Paris - discoverparis.com', 'url': 'https://discoverparis.com/', 'id': 'https://discoverparis.com/', 'score': 0.3457365036010742, 'published_date': '2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z', 'author': 'Creatrs.ai'}, page_content=\"Interested in owning this website?
