        ">[Apify Actors](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors) are cloud programs designed for a wide range of web scraping, crawling, and data extraction tasks. These actors facilitate automated data gathering from the web, enabling users to extract, process, and store information efficiently. Actors can be used to perform tasks like scraping e-commerce sites for product details, monitoring price changes, or gathering search engine results. They integrate seamlessly with [Apify Datasets](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/dataset), allowing the structured data collected by actors to be stored, managed, and exported in formats like JSON, CSV, or Excel for further analysis or use.\n",
