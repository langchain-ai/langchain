He had been due to face Czech player Tomáš Machác\\xa0in the singles at 1:30 p.m. (8:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday.\\n“Unfortunately, despite working incredibly hard on his recovery since his operation just over a week ago, Andy has taken the very difficult decision not to play the singles this year,” his team said in a statement reported by Sky News.\\n“As you can imagine, he is extremely disappointed but has confirmed that he will be playing in the doubles with Jamie and looks forward to competing at Wimbledon for the last time.”\\nSky News is owned by Comcast, the parent company of NBC News.\\nWishing him well in a post on X, Wimbledon said it was “sorry to hear you won’t be playing singles this year.”\\nMurray also still hopes to appear at the Paris Olympics, after which, he has said, he will retire from the sport.\\nThe news caps a glittering career on the ATP singles tour, which placed Murray at No. 1 in the world for 41 weeks. He was in the top 10 male players in the world for almost 10 years, from July 2008 to October 2017.\\nFor a time, the media included Murray in the so-called Big Four group of players, along with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.\\nMurray, who is Scottish, became the first male British singles champion since Fred Perry in 1936, becoming one of the most lauded British sports stars in the process.\\nMurray has a long history with multiple injuries, and he declared in 2017 that it was unlikely he would compete in a professional tournament again after he withdrew from the U.S. Open because of a recurring hip injury.\\n\\nAndy Murray waves to the crowd after his Wimbledon exit in 2022.Justin Setterfield / Getty Images file\\nSuccessive operations allowed him, against the odds, to return to elite tennis, and he reached the third round of Wimbledon in 2021.

played his final ever singles tournament at Wimbledon in 2021, before retiring from tennis one year later.\\nAfter 24 years on the ATP Tour, Federer retired from tennis in 2022, having forged a legacy that most could only dream of.\\nFederer won 20 Grand Slam titles during his time as a professional, spent 310 weeks as world number one, and won Wimbledon a record eight times.\\n\\nPhoto by Visionhaus/Corbis via Getty Images\\nThe Swiss enjoyed legendary rivalries with the likes of Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, both of whom he shared the court with on many occasions.\\nFederer’s final match came at the 2022 Laver Cup, a competition which he helped create, as he played alongside rival and friend Nadal, in a loss to the American duo of Frances Tiafoe and Jack Sock.\\nHowever, his last singles match came one year prior, as he fell to a now eight-time ATP Tour champion, at the tournament he dominated for much of his career.\\nHubert Hurkacz: The man who beat Roger Federer in his last match at Wimbledon\\nHaving played just one of the previous four Grand Slam tournaments, expectations weren’t too high for Federer as he entered Wimbledon in 2021, still struggling with his knee.\\nThe 43-year-old underwent numerous surgeries on his right knee during the latter stages of his career, which never quite saw him return to full fitness.\\nRegardless, Federer battled his way through the opening rounds at SW19, beating Adrian Mannarino, Richard Gasquet, Cameron Norrie, and Lorenzo Sonego, to qualify for the quarter-finals.\\n\\nPhoto by GLYN KIRK/AFP via Getty Images\\nMore Tennis News\\nIt was the 18th time Federer had reached the quarter-final stage of Wimbledon, but unlike so many times before, this was as far as he would go.\\nHubert Hurkacz awaited Federer, a big serving Pole, who was enjoying the best year of his career to date.\\nThe 27-year-old had won his second-ever ATP title in Delray Beach earlier in the year, before he took home a maiden Masters 1000 title in Miami against future world number-one Jannik Sinner.\\n\\nPhoto by Matthew Stockman/Getty Images\\nIn good form, that quickly translated as Hurkacz took the first set against the Swiss legend 6-3.\\nIn true Federer fashion, he battled back in the second set, taking things to a tiebreaker, a golden opportunity for him to level things up.\\nIt wasn’t to be, however, as Federer made several uncharacteristic errors in the tiebreak as Hurkacz clinched the second set 7-6 (7-4).\\nWhat happened in the third set, happened to Federer just three times during his entire career, as Hurkacz beat him 6-0, sending him out of Wimbledon in convincing fashion.\\nIt wasn’t known at the time, but this would be Federer’s final singles match at Wimbledon, and in tennis altogether.\\nFollowing the match, Hurkacz was grateful to have played one of the sport’s greatest ever players at Wimbledon.\\n“I don’t know what to say, it’s super special for me,” he said.\\n“I’ve been playing on this special court against Roger [Federer], it’s like a dream come true to play him.\\n“The special things that he has done here throughout his whole career, it’s a dream come true.”\\nWith his win in the quarter-finals, Hurkacz qualified for the last four of a Major for the first time in his career before losing to Matteo Berrettini in the semis.\\nThe 27-year-old is yet to return to the semi-finals of a Grand Slam, another reason that his win over Federer will live long in the memory.\\nWhat happened to Hubert Hurkacz after beating Roger Federer at Wimbledon?\\nAfter scoring the biggest win of his career at Wimbledon, Hurkacz established himself as a top-ten talent on the ATP Tour.\\nThe Pole finished the year ninth, tenth, and ninth again from 2021-2023, before regressing slightly in 2024 as he currently sits ranked 16th in the world.\\nHaving won three titles before announcing himself on the world stage against Federer three years ago, the 27-year-old has since added to his trophy cabinet on numerous occasions.\\nDateTournamentTierOpponentAug 2019Winston-Salem OpenATP 250Benoit PaireJan 2021Delray Beach OpenATP 250Sebastian KordaApr 2021Miami

winning in Shanghai.\\nDespite Hurkacz winning a title in Estoril earlier this year, performances did somewhat disappoint, however, and the Pole decided to make a big change ahead of 2025.\\n\\nPhoto by Carlos Rodrigues/Getty Images\\nHurkacz recently announced his new coaching team, which will see eight-time Grand Slam winner Ivan Lendl, and former Olympic Gold medallist Nicolas Massu link up with the Pole.\\nBoth have achieved Major success as a coach, with Lendl picking up three Grand Slam titles with Andy Murray, and Massu working alongside Dominic Thiem to win the 2020 US Open.\\nHurkacz will be hoping that the wealth of experience he now has alongside him will propel him to big things in the new year.\\nThe Pole will return to action for the United Cup, which begins on December 27.\\nATPHubert HurkaczRoger FedererWimbledon\\nRelated Posts\\nMore in Features\\nMore in Features\\nClose\\nSearch\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Us\\n\\nEditorial Policy\\nMeet The

Especially given that clay-court tennis continues when there is light rain, so the effect can be especially keenly felt.\\nAt this year’s tournament, the Paris weather was wet and cold. The rain dampens playing conditions and spirits alike, leaving players a little more tired, a little more tetchy. At times, the mood was a bit like a damp summer holiday — with everyone indoors and cabin fever taking over.\\nWhen the rains came, the players came off. The crowds milled. The rain continued. The entire venue was in a wet, grey freeze-frame, broken only by the signature terracotta orange — not of the courts, but of the tarpaulins protecting them.\\nBut why does weather make such a difference to tennis at Roland Garros?

The pair had tickets for four days of the French Open, all of which have been heavily disrupted by rain, with one day a near-total washout.\\nThere is something special about these days, with big matches everywhere you look. These outside courts are so close together, you could watch two matches simultaneously.\\nYou genuinely don’t know where to look; standing between home favourite Chloe Paquet in her thrilling win against 32nd seed Katerina Siniakova on Court Seven, and Grand Slam semi-finalist Felix Auger-Aliassime taking on qualifier Henri Squire on Court Nine.\\nThe banquet of matches on the outside courts (when the rain stayed away) meant that for most spectators, morale remained higher than it appeared for Gilly and Beverly.

I learned that a turtle can breathe through its butt.”\\nThis slightly surreal revelation comes from 2016 Wimbledon runner-up Milos Raonic as he reflects on how he passed the time during one of the many lengthy rain delays during the 2023 competition.\\nRain, as big a Wimbledon preoccupation as strawberries and cream, has been one of the big talking points so far of this year’s Championships.\\nIt’s extremely frustrating for the fans and the tournament when this happens (costing Wimbledon about £250,000/$317,200 in refunds on Tuesday), but what about the players? How do they pass hour after hour when they don’t know if they’re coming or going?\\nWell, aside from turtle trivia and being on their phone sending messages and watching videos, here’s how they do it — including planning for a Shania Twain concert, trips to the on-site hair salon, and putting together Lego models and jigsaw puzzles to keep the mind active.\\nRead The Athletic's piece from the last Wimbledon tournament below.\\n GO FURTHER What do tennis players do at Wimbledon when rain stops play?\\n July 2, 2024 at 7:20 AM EDT Max Mathews· Live Reporter\\n\\nGet the brollies out!\\n\\nGetty Images\\nFor our American readers, 'brolly' is a silly English word for umbrella.\\nOne of many silly English words.\\nIn the meantime, let's read about rain delays: their impact on small courts and schedules, what players do while they're waiting, and how precipitation played havoc with the 2024 French Open.\\nStick around.\\n July 2, 2024 at 7:13 AM EDT Max Mathews· Live Reporter\\n\\nBreaking: Rain delays at Wimbledon\\nUmbrellas are going up and play has been suspended due to rain.\\nAll matches have been temporarily put on pause.\\nMore updates as they come.\\n July 2, 2024 at 7:03 AM EDT Charlie Eccleshare· Tennis Writer in Melbourne\\n\\nTime for a passing of the torch?\\nAfter the news of Andy Murray's withdrawal from the singles, British men's singles hopes at Wimbledon will have to rest on someone else’s shoulders. The man best suited for that role appears to be Jack Draper, the 29th seed.\\nThe 22-year-old became the new British No 1 off the back of a very impressive grass-court buildup, winning his first ATP title in Stuttgart on June 17 and beating the Wimbledon and French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz to reach the Cinch Championships quarterfinals at Queen’s Club.\\nA title and a statement win were two of the main things missing from his CV, and now he’s targeting something else he’s never done: a run at Wimbledon. For obvious reasons, good progress at the London Grand Slam is what cements British players in the nation’s psyche.

That was his superpower. There were better players in his era; there were more stylish ones. But none possessed the ability to make you invest emotionally in their matches as much as Murray did.\\nWhen he arrived on the scene as a scruffy 18-year-old in 2005, Murray seemed to experience tennis as I’d always experienced it: as an unbelievably frustrating sport that seemed almost designed to wind you up. Even saying “Take your time, you d**k” after missing a serve, as Murray once did, wasn’t that odd to me.\\nOn the court, his complete determination, raw emotions and supreme athleticism added to his appeal — and throughout it all, he was a potent combination of the superhuman and the relatable.\\nBonds were strengthened with those people who could see how great and thoughtful Murray really was. “If you don’t like Andy Murray then we can’t be friends” became a good mantra to live by. Clearly, this was all unhinged.\\nBut that’s the thing: Andy Murray made you care.

Physically, it’s just too tough now,” Murray said in his interview on court, after watching the video.\\n\\n“I want to play forever, I love the sport. It’s given me so much, taught me loads of lessons over the years that I can use in the rest of my life. I don’t want to stop, so it is hard.”\\n\\nGrand slam champions Novak Djokovic, Iga Świątek, Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe were just some of the famous faces in attendance for the short ceremony, and they joined thousands of fans in giving Murray a standing ovation.\\n\\nMurray’s family, including his two young daughters, also watched on from the stands.\\n\\n“Mum and dad were amazing support when we were little in allowing us to pursue our dreams […] Thank you, mum and dad,” a tearful Murray said, before speaking about his wife, Kim.\\n\\n“She has been an amazing support to me, to my whole family, she is the best mum.
