He had been due to face Czech player Tomáš Machác\\xa0in the singles at 1:30 p.m. (8:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday.\\n“Unfortunately, despite working incredibly hard on his recovery since his operation just over a week ago, Andy has taken the very difficult decision not to play the singles this year,” his team said in a statement reported by Sky News.\\n“As you can imagine, he is extremely disappointed but has confirmed that he will be playing in the doubles with Jamie and looks forward to competing at Wimbledon for the last time.”\\nSky News is owned by Comcast, the parent company of NBC News.\\nWishing him well in a post on X, Wimbledon said it was “sorry to hear you won’t be playing singles this year.”\\nMurray also still hopes to appear at the Paris Olympics, after which, he has said, he will retire from the sport.\\nThe news caps a glittering career on the ATP singles tour, which placed Murray at No. 1 in the world for 41 weeks. He was in the top 10 male players in the world for almost 10 years, from July 2008 to October 2017.\\nFor a time, the media included Murray in the so-called Big Four group of players, along with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.\\nMurray, who is Scottish, became the first male British singles champion since Fred Perry in 1936, becoming one of the most lauded British sports stars in the process.\\nMurray has a long history with multiple injuries, and he declared in 2017 that it was unlikely he would compete in a professional tournament again after he withdrew from the U.S. Open because of a recurring hip injury.\\n\\nAndy Murray waves to the crowd after his Wimbledon exit in 2022.Justin Setterfield / Getty Images file\\nSuccessive operations allowed him, against the odds, to return to elite tennis, and he reached the third round of Wimbledon in 2021.
