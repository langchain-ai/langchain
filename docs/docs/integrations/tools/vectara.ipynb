    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[Vectara](https://vectara.com/) is the trusted AI Assistant and Agent platform which focuses on enterprise readiness for mission-critical applications. For more [details](../providers/vectara.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Vectara](https://vectara.com/)  provides several tools that can be used with LangChain.\n",
    "- **VectaraSearch**: For semantic search over your corpus\n",
    "- **VectaraRAG**: For generating summaries using RAG\n",
    "- **VectaraIngest**: For ingesting documents into your corpus\n",
    "- **VectaraAddFiles**: For uploading the files\n",

    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, use the following steps:\n",
    "1. If you don't already have one, [Sign up](https://www.vectara.com/integrations/langchain) for your free Vectara trial.\n",
    "2. Within your account you can create one or more corpora. Each corpus represents an area that stores text data upon ingest from input documents. To create a corpus, use the **\"Create Corpus\"** button. You then provide a name to your corpus as well as a description. Optionally you can define filtering attributes and apply some advanced options. If you click on your created corpus, you can see its name and corpus ID right on the top.\n",
    "3. Next you'll need to create API keys to access the corpus. Click on the **\"Access Control\"** tab in the corpus view and then the **\"Create API Key\"** button. Give your key a name, and choose whether you want query-only or query+index for your key. Click \"Create\" and you now have an active API key. Keep this key confidential. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use LangChain with Vectara, you'll need to have these two values: `corpus_key` and `api_key`.\n",
    "You can provide `VECTARA_API_KEY` to LangChain in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instantiation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Include in your environment these two variables: `VECTARA_API_KEY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, you can set these variables using os.environ and getpass as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import getpass\n",
    "\n",
    "os.environ[\"VECTARA_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"Vectara API Key:\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add them to the `Vectara` vectorstore constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "vectara = Vectara(\n",
    "    vectara_api_key=vectara_api_key\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we assume they are provided in the environment."

       "  AIMessage(content=\"An API key and a JWT (JSON Web Token) are both methods used for authentication and authorization in web applications, but they serve different purposes and have different characteristics.\\n\\n### API Key\\n- **Definition**: An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate a client making requests to an API. It is typically a long string of characters that is passed along with the API request.\\n- **Usage**: API keys are often used for simple authentication scenarios where the client needs to be identified, but there is no need for complex user authentication or session management.\\n- **Security**: API keys can be less secure than other methods because they are often static and can be easily exposed if not handled properly. They should be kept secret and not included in public code repositories.\\n- **When to Use**: Use API keys for server-to-server communication, when you need to track usage, or when you want to restrict access to certain features of an API.\\n\\n### JWT (JSON Web Token)\\n- **Definition**: A JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The payload typically contains user information and claims.\\n- **Usage**: JWTs are commonly used for user authentication and authorization in web applications. They allow for stateless authentication, meaning the server does not need to store session information.\\n- **Security**: JWTs can be more secure than API keys because they can include expiration times and can be signed to verify their authenticity. However, if a JWT is compromised, it can be used until it expires.\\n- **When to Use**: Use JWTs when you need to authenticate users, manage sessions, or pass claims between parties securely. They are particularly useful in single-page applications (SPAs) and microservices architectures.\\n\\n### Summary\\n- **API Key**: Best for simple authentication and tracking API usage. Less secure and static.\\n- **JWT**: Best for user authentication and authorization with claims. More secure and supports stateless sessions.\\n\\nIn general, choose the method that best fits your application's security requirements and architecture.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 436, 'prompt_tokens': 66, 'total_tokens': 502, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_dbaca60df0', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BPZK7UZveFJrGkT3iwjNQ2XHCmbqF', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-4717221a-cd77-4627-aa34-3ee1b2a3803e-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 66, 'output_tokens': 436, 'total_tokens': 502, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]}"
