    "# Writer Text Splitter\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a quick overview for getting started with Writer's [text splitter](/docs/concepts/text_splitters/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Writer's [context-aware splitting endpoint](https://dev.writer.com/api-guides/tools#context-aware-text-splitting) provides intelligent text splitting capabilities for long documents (up to 4000 words). Unlike simple character-based splitting, it preserves the semantic meaning and context between chunks, making it ideal for processing long-form content while maintaining coherence. In `langchain-writer`, we provide usage of Writer's context-aware splitting endpoint as a LangChain text splitter.\n",
