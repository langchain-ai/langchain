    "The `Github` toolkit contains tools that enable an LLM agent to interact with a github repository. \n",
    "The tool is a wrapper for the [PyGitHub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub) library. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the pygithub library\n",
    "2. Create a Github app\n",
    "3. Set your environmental variables\n",
    "4. Pass the tools to your agent with `toolkit.get_tools()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these steps will be explained in great detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Get Issues**- fetches issues from the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Get Issue**- fetches details about a specific issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comment on Issue**- posts a comment on a specific issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create Pull Request**- creates a pull request from the bot's working branch to the base branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Create File**- creates a new file in the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Read File**- reads a file from the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Update File**- updates a file in the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Delete File**- deletes a file from the repository.\n",
