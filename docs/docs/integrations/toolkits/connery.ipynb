    "# Connery Toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this toolkit, you can integrate Connery Actions into your LangChain agents and chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use only one particular Connery Action in your agent,\n",
    "check out the [Connery Action Tool](/docs/integrations/tools/connery) documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Connery?\n",
    "\n",
    "Connery is an open-source plugin infrastructure for AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Connery, you can easily create a custom plugin with a set of actions and seamlessly integrate them into your LangChain agents and chains. \n",
    "Connery will handle the rest: runtime, authorization, secret management, access management, audit logs, and other vital features.\n",
    "Additionally, Connery and our community offer a wide range of ready-to-use open-source plugins for your convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn more about Connery:\n",
    "\n",
    "- GitHub: https://github.com/connery-io/connery-platform\n",
    "- Documentation: https://docs.connery.io\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Connery Actions in your LangChain agents, you need to do some preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up the Connery runner using the [Quickstart](https://docs.connery.io/docs/platform/quick-start/) guide.\n",
    "2. Install all the plugins with the actions you want to use in your agent.\n",
    "3. Set environment variables `CONNERY_RUNNER_URL` and `CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY` so the toolkit can communicate with the Connery Runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we create an agent that uses two Connery Actions to summarize a public webpage and send the summary by email:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Summarize public webpage** from the [Summarization](https://github.com/connery-io/summarization-plugin) plugin.\n",
    "2. **Send email** from the [Gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Connery Action is a structured tool, so you can only use it in the agents supporting structured tools."
