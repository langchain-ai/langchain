# CrateDB

> [CrateDB] is a distributed and scalable SQL database for storing and
> analyzing massive amounts of data in near real-time, even with complex
> queries. It is PostgreSQL-compatible, based on Lucene, and inheriting
> from Elasticsearch.


## Installation and Setup

### Setup CrateDB
There are two ways to get started with CrateDB quickly. Alternatively,
choose other [CrateDB installation options].

#### Start CrateDB on your local machine
Example: Run a single-node CrateDB instance with security disabled,
using Docker or Podman. This is not recommended for production use.

```bash
docker run --name=cratedb --rm \
  --publish=4200:4200 --publish=5432:5432 --env=CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=2g \
  crate:latest -Cdiscovery.type=single-node
```

#### Deploy cluster on CrateDB Cloud
[CrateDB Cloud] is a managed CrateDB service. Sign up for a
[free trial][CrateDB Cloud Console].

### Install Client
Install the most recent version of the `langchain-cratedb` package
and a few others that are needed for this tutorial.
```bash
pip install --upgrade langchain-cratedb langchain-openai unstructured
```


## Documentation
For a more detailed walkthrough of the CrateDB wrapper, see
[using LangChain with CrateDB]. See also [all features of CrateDB]
to learn about other functionality provided by CrateDB.


## Features
The CrateDB adapter for LangChain provides APIs to use CrateDB as vector store,
document loader, and storage for chat messages.

### Vector Store
Use the CrateDB vector store functionality around `FLOAT_VECTOR` and `KNN_MATCH`
for similarity search and other purposes. See also [CrateDBVectorStore Tutorial].

Make sure you've configured a valid OpenAI API key.
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XJZ...
```
```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import UnstructuredURLLoader
from langchain_cratedb import CrateDBVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter

loader = UnstructuredURLLoader(urls=["https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/raw/refs/tags/langchain-core==0.3.28/docs/docs/how_to/state_of_the_union.txt"])
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# Connect to a self-managed CrateDB instance on localhost.
CONNECTION_STRING = "crate://?schema=testdrive"

store = CrateDBVectorStore.from_documents(
    documents=docs,
    embedding=embeddings,
    collection_name="state_of_the_union",
    connection=CONNECTION_STRING,
)

query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs_with_score = store.similarity_search_with_score(query)
```

### Document Loader
Load load documents from a CrateDB database table, using the document loader
`CrateDBLoader`, which is based on SQLAlchemy. See also [CrateDBLoader Tutorial].

To use the document loader in your applications:
```python
import sqlalchemy as sa
from langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase
from langchain_cratedb import CrateDBLoader

# Connect to a self-managed CrateDB instance on localhost.
CONNECTION_STRING = "crate://?schema=testdrive"

db = SQLDatabase(engine=sa.create_engine(CONNECTION_STRING))

loader = CrateDBLoader(
    'SELECT * FROM sys.summits LIMIT 42',
    db=db,
)
documents = loader.load()
```

### Chat Message History
Use CrateDB as the storage for your chat messages.
See also [CrateDBChatMessageHistory Tutorial].

To use the chat message history in your applications:
```python
from langchain_cratedb import CrateDBChatMessageHistory

# Connect to a self-managed CrateDB instance on localhost.
CONNECTION_STRING = "crate://?schema=testdrive"

message_history = CrateDBChatMessageHistory(
    session_id="test-session",
    connection=CONNECTION_STRING,
)

message_history.add_user_message("hi!")
```
