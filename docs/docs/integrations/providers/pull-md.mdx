## Document Loader

The `PullMdLoader` class in `langchain-pull-md` provides an easy way to convert URLs to Markdown. It's particularly useful for loading content from modern web applications for use within LangChain's processing capabilities.

```python
from langchain_pull_md import PullMdLoader

# Initialize the loader with a URL of a JavaScript-rendered webpage
loader = PullMdLoader(url='https://example.com')

# Load the content as a Document
documents = loader.load()

# Access the Markdown content
for document in documents:
    print(document.page_content)
```

This loader supports any URL and is particularly adept at handling sites built with dynamic JavaScript, making it a versatile tool for markdown extraction in data processing workflows.
