# Box

[Box](https://box.com) is the Intelligent Content Cloud, a single platform that enables 
organizations to fuel collaboration, manage the entire content lifecycle, secure critical content, 
and transform business workflows with enterprise AI. Founded in 2005, Box simplifies work for 
leading global organizations, including AstraZeneca, JLL, Morgan Stanley, and Nationwide.

In this package, we make available a number of ways to include Box content in your AI workflows. 

### Installation and setup

```bash
pip install -U langchain-box

```

# langchain-box

This package contains the LangChain integration with Box. For more information about
Box, check out our [developer documentation](https://developer.box.com).

## Pre-requisites

In order to integrate with Box, you need a few things:

* A Box instance — if you are not a current Box customer, sign up for a 
[free dev account](https://account.box.com/signup/n/developer#ty9l3).
* A Box app — more on how to 
[create an app](https://developer.box.com/guides/getting-started/first-application/)
* Your app approved in your Box instance — This is done by your admin.
The good news is if you are using a free developer account, you are the admin.
[Authorize your app](https://developer.box.com/guides/authorization/custom-app-approval/#manual-approval)

## Authentication

The `box-langchain` package offers some flexibility to authentication. The
most basic authentication method is by using a developer token. This can be
found in the [Box developer console](https://account.box.com/developers/console) 
on the configuration screen. This token is purposely short-lived (1 hour) and is 
intended for development. With this token, you can add it to your environment as 
`BOX_DEVELOPER_TOKEN`, you can pass it directly to the loader, or you can use the 
`BoxAuth` authentication helper class.

We will cover passing it directly to the loader in the section below. 

### BoxAuth helper class

`BoxAuth` supports the following authentication methods:

* Token — either a developer token or any token generated through the Box SDK
* JWT with a service account
* JWT with a specified user
* CCG with a service account
* CCG with a specified user

:::note
If using JWT authentication, you will need to download the configuration from the Box
developer console after generating your public/private key pair. Place this file in your 
application directory structure somewhere. You will use the path to this file when using
the `BoxAuth` helper class.

for more about our different authentication options.

Examples:

**Token**

```python
from langchain_box.document_loaders import BoxLoader
from langchain_box.utilities import BoxAuth, BoxAuthType

auth = BoxAuth(
    auth_type=BoxAuthType.TOKEN,
    box_developer_token=box_developer_token
)

loader = BoxLoader(
    box_auth=auth,
    ...
)
```

**JWT with a service account**

```python
from langchain_box.document_loaders import BoxLoader
from langchain_box.utilities import BoxAuth, BoxAuthType

auth = BoxAuth(
    auth_type=BoxAuthType.JWT,
    box_jwt_path=box_jwt_path
)

loader = BoxLoader(
    box_auth=auth,
    ...
```

**JWT with a specified user**

```python
from langchain_box.document_loaders import BoxLoader
from langchain_box.utilities import BoxAuth, BoxAuthType

auth = BoxAuth(
    auth_type=BoxAuthType.JWT,
    box_jwt_path=box_jwt_path,
    box_user_id=box_user_id
)

loader = BoxLoader(
    box_auth=auth,
    ...
```

**CCG with a service account**

```python
from langchain_box.document_loaders import BoxLoader
from langchain_box.utilities import BoxAuth, BoxAuthType

auth = BoxAuth(
    auth_type=BoxAuthType.CCG,
    box_client_id=box_client_id,
    box_client_secret=box_client_secret,
    box_enterprise_id=box_enterprise_id
)

loader = BoxLoader(
    box_auth=auth,
    ...
```

**CCG with a specified user**

```python
from langchain_box.document_loaders import BoxLoader
from langchain_box.utilities import BoxAuth, BoxAuthType

auth = BoxAuth(
    auth_type=BoxAuthType.CCG,
    box_client_id=box_client_id,
    box_client_secret=box_client_secret,
    box_user_id=box_user_id
)

loader = BoxLoader(
    box_auth=auth,
    ...
```

If you wish to use OAuth2 with the authorization_code flow, please use `BoxAuthType.TOKEN` with the token you have acquired.
