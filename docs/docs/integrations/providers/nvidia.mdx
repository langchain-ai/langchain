# NVIDIA

>[Nvidia Corporation (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia) is an American multinational 
> corporation and technology company. It is a software and fabless company which 
> designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) 
> for data science and high-performance computing as well as system on 
> a chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. 
> `Nvidia` is also a dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software.

## NVIDIA AI Foundation Endpoints

>`NVIDIA` provides an integration package for `LangChain`: `langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints`.

> [NVIDIA AI Foundation Endpoints](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/) give users easy access to NVIDIA hosted API endpoints for 
> NVIDIA AI Foundation Models like `Mixtral 8x7B`, `Llama 2`, `Stable Diffusion`, etc. These models, 
> hosted on the [NVIDIA NGC catalog](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/ai-foundation-models), are optimized, tested, and hosted on 
> the NVIDIA AI platform, making them fast and easy to evaluate, further customize, 
> and seamlessly run at peak performance on any accelerated stack.
> 
> With [NVIDIA AI Foundation Endpoints](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/), you can get quick results from a fully 
> accelerated stack running on [NVIDIA DGX Cloud](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/). Once customized, these 
> models can be deployed anywhere with enterprise-grade security, stability, 
> and support using [NVIDIA AI Enterprise](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/).

A selection of NVIDIA AI Foundation models is supported directly in LangChain with familiar APIs.

The supported models can be found [in NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/ai-foundation-models).

These models can be accessed via the [`langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints`](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints/) 
package, as shown below.

### Setting up

- Create a free [NVIDIA NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/) account.
- Navigate to `Catalog > AI Foundation Models > (Model with API endpoint)`.
- Select `API` and generate the key `NVIDIA_API_KEY`.

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=nvapi-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

- Install a package:

```bash
pip install -U langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints
```
