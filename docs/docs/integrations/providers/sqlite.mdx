# SQLite

>[SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite) is a database engine written in the 
> C programming language. It is not a standalone app; rather, it is a library that 
> software developers embed in their apps. As such, it belongs to the family of 
> embedded databases. It is the most widely deployed database engine, as it is 
> used by several of the top web browsers, operating systems, mobile phones, and other embedded systems.
