# MariaDB

This page covers how to use the [MariaDB](https://github.com/mariadb/) ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific PGVector wrappers.

## Installation
- Install c/c connector

on Debian, Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt install libmariadb3 libmariadb-dev
```

on CentOS, RHEL, Rocky Linux
```bash
sudo yum install MariaDB-shared MariaDB-devel
```

- Install the Python connector package with `pip install mariadb`


## Setup
1. The first step is to have a MariaDB 11.7.1 or later installed.

    The docker image is the easiest way to get started.

## Wrappers

### VectorStore

There exists a wrapper around MariaDB vector databases, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore,
whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vectorstore:
```python
from langchain_mariadb import MariaDBStore
```

### Usage

For a more detailed walkthrough of the MariaDB wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/mariadb)
