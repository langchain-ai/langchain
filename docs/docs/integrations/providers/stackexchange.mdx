# Stack Exchange

>[Stack Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange) is a network of 
question-and-answer (Q&A) websites on topics in diverse fields, each site covering 
a specific topic, where questions, answers, and users are subject to a reputation award process.

This page covers how to use the `Stack Exchange API` within LangChain.

## Installation and Setup
- Install requirements with 
```bash
pip install stackapi
```

## Wrappers

### Utility

There exists a StackExchangeAPIWrapper utility which wraps this API. To import this utility:

```python
from langchain_community.utilities import StackExchangeAPIWrapper
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of this wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/tools/stackexchange).

### Tool

You can also easily load this wrapper as a Tool (to use with an Agent).
You can do this with:
```python
from langchain.agents import load_tools
tools = load_tools(["stackexchange"])
```

For more information on tools, see [this page](/docs/modules/agents/tools/).
