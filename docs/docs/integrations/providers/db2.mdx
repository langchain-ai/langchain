### IBM DB2 Vector Store and Vector Search

The IBM DB2 relational database v12.1.2 and above offers the abilities of vector store and vector search. Installation of `langchain-db2` package will give Langchain users the support of DB2 vector store and vector search.
See detailed usage example in Jupyter Notebook [/docs/integrations/vectorstores/db2.ipynb](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/db2.ipynb).

Installation: This is a seperate package for vector store feature only and can be run without the `langchain-ibm` package.
```python
pip install langchain-db2
```
Usage:
```
from langchain_db2 import db2vs
from langchain_db2.db2vs import DB2VS
```
