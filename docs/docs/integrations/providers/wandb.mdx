`Weights & Biase` products can be used to log metrics and artifacts during training, 
and to trace the execution of your code.

There are several main ways to use `Weights & Biases` products within LangChain:
- with `wandb_tracing_enabled`
- with `Weave` lightweight toolkit
- with `WandbCallbackHandler` (deprecated)


## wandb_tracing_enabled

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/providers/wandb_tracing).

See in the [W&B documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/langchain).

```python
from langchain_community.callbacks import wandb_tracing_enabled
```

## Weave

See in the [W&B documentation](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/langchain).


## WandbCallbackHandler

**Note:** the `WandbCallbackHandler` is being deprecated in favour of the `wandb_tracing_enabled`.

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/providers/wandb_tracking).

See in the [W&B documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/langchain).

```python
