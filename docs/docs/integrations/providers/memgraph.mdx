>Memgraph is a high-performance, in-memory graph database that is optimized for real-time queries and analytics.
>Get started with Memgraph by visiting [their website](https://memgraph.com/).

## Installation and Setup

- Install the Python SDK with `pip install langchain-memgraph`

## MemgraphQAChain

There exists a wrapper around Memgraph graph database that allows you to generate Cypher statements based on the user input
and use them to retrieve relevant information from the database.

```python
from langchain_memgraph.chains.graph_qa import MemgraphQAChain
from langchain_memgraph.graphs.memgraph import Memgraph
```

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/graphs/memgraph)

## Constructing a Knowledge Graph from unstructured data

You can use the integration to construct a knowledge graph from unstructured data.

```python
from langchain_memgraph.graphs.memgraph import Memgraph
from langchain_experimental.graph_transformers import LLMGraphTransformer
```

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/graphs/memgraph)

## Memgraph Tools and Toolkit

Memgraph also provides a toolkit that allows you to interact with the Memgraph database.
See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/tools/memgraph).

```python
from langchain_memgraph import MemgraphToolkit
```
