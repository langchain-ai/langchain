## Embedding Models

### HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings

>[BGE models on the HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) 
> are one of [the best open-source embedding models](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard).

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/bge_huggingface).

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings
```

### IpexLLMBgeEmbeddings

>[IPEX-LLM](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm) is a PyTorch 
> library for running LLM on Intel CPU and GPU (e.g., local PC with iGPU, 
> discrete GPU such as Arc, Flex and Max) with very low latency.

See a [usage example running model on Intel CPU](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/ipex_llm).
See a [usage example running model on Intel GPU](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/ipex_llm_gpu).

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import IpexLLMBgeEmbeddings
```

### QuantizedBgeEmbeddings

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/itrex).

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import QuantizedBgeEmbeddings
```
