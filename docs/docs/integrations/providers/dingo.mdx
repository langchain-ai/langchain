# DingoDB

>[DingoDB](https://github.com/dingodb) is a distributed multi-modal vector
> database. It combines the features of a data lake and a vector database,
> allowing for the storage of any type of data (key-value, PDF, audio,
> video, etc.) regardless of its size. Utilizing DingoDB, you can construct
> your own Vector Ocean (the next-generation data architecture following data
> warehouse and data lake). This enables
> the analysis of both structured and unstructured data through
> a singular SQL with exceptionally low latency in real time.

## Installation and Setup

Install the Python SDK

```bash
pip install dingodb
```

## VectorStore

There exists a wrapper around DingoDB indexes, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore,
whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vectorstore:

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Dingo
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of the DingoDB wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/dingo)
