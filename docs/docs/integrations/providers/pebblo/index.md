# Pebblo

[Pebblo](https://www.daxa.ai/pebblo) enables developers to safely load and retrieve data to promote their Gen AI app to deployment without
worrying about the organizationâ€™s compliance and security requirements. The Pebblo SafeLoader identifies semantic topics and entities found in the
loaded data and the Pebblo SafeRetriever enforces identity and semantic controls on the retrieved context. The results are
summarized on the UI or a PDF report.


## Pebblo Overview:

`Pebblo` provides a safe way to load and retrieve data for Gen AI applications. 
It includes:
1. **Identity-aware Safe Loader** that loads data and identifies semantic topics and entities.
2. **SafeRetrieval**  that enforces identity and semantic controls on the retrieved context.
3. **User Data Report** that summarizes the data loaded and retrieved.
