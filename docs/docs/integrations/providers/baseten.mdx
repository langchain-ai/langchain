# Baseten

>[Baseten](https://baseten.co) is a provider of all the infrastructure you need to deploy and serve
> ML models performantly, scalably, and cost-efficiently.

>As a model inference platform, `Baseten` is a `Provider` in the LangChain ecosystem.
The `Baseten` integration currently implements a single `Component`, LLMs, but more are planned!

>`Baseten` lets you run both open source models like Llama 2 or Mistral and run proprietary or
fine-tuned models on dedicated GPUs. If you're used to a provider like OpenAI, using Baseten has a few differences:

>* Rather than paying per token, you pay per minute of GPU used.
>* Every model on Baseten uses [Truss](https://truss.baseten.co/welcome), our open-source model packaging framework, for maximum customizability.
>* While we have some [OpenAI ChatCompletions-compatible models](https://docs.baseten.co/api-reference/openai), you can define your own I/O spec with `Truss`.

## Installation and Setup

You'll need two things to use Baseten models with LangChain:

* A [Baseten account](https://baseten.co)
* An [API key](https://docs.baseten.co/observability/api-keys)

Export your API key to your as an environment variable called `BASETEN_API_KEY`.

```sh
export BASETEN_API_KEY="paste_your_api_key_here"
```

## LLMs

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/llms/baseten).

```python
from langchain_community.llms import Baseten
```
