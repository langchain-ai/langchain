# Apache Software Foundation

>[The Apache Software Foundation (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apache_Software_Foundation)
> is a decentralized open source community of developers. The software they
> produce is distributed under the terms of the Apache License, a permissive
> open-source license for free and open-source software (FOSS). The Apache projects
> are characterized by a collaborative, consensus-based development process
> and an open and pragmatic software license, which is to say that it
> allows developers, who receive the software freely, to redistribute
> it under non-free terms. Each project is managed by a self-selected
> team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project.

## Apache AGE

>[Apache AGE](https://age.apache.org/) is a `PostgreSQL` extension that provides
> graph database functionality. `AGE` is an acronym for `A Graph Extension`, and
> is inspired by Bitnine’s fork of `PostgreSQL 10`, `AgensGraph`, which is
> a multimodal database. The goal of the project is to create single
> storage that can handle both relational and graph model data so that users
> can use standard ANSI SQL along with `openCypher`, the Graph query language.
> The data elements `Apache AGE` stores are nodes, edges connecting them, and
> attributes of nodes and edges.

See more about [integrating with Apache AGE](/docs/integrations/graphs/apache_age).

## Apache Cassandra

>[Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) is a NoSQL, row-oriented,
> highly scalable and highly available database. Starting with version 5.0,
> the database ships with vector search capabilities.

## Apache Doris

>[Apache Doris](https://doris.apache.org/) is a modern data warehouse for
> real-time analytics. It delivers lightning-fast analytics on real-time data at scale.
>
>Usually `Apache Doris` is categorized into OLAP, and it has showed excellent
> performance in ClickBench — a Benchmark For Analytical DBMS. Since it has
> a super-fast vectorized execution engine, it could also be used as a fast vectordb.

## Apache Kafka

>[Apache Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka) is a distributed messaging system
> that is used to publish and subscribe to streams of records.

See more about [integrating with Apache Kafka](/docs/integrations/memory/kafka_chat_message_history).


## Apache Spark

>[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is a unified analytics engine for
> large-scale data processing. It provides high-level APIs in Scala, Java,
> Python, and R, and an optimized engine that supports general computation
> graphs for data analysis. It also supports a rich set of higher-level
> tools including `Spark SQL` for SQL and DataFrames, `pandas API on Spark`
> for pandas workloads, `MLlib` for machine learning,
> `GraphX` for graph processing, and `Structured Streaming` for stream processing.
