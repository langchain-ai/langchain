# OpenLLM

OpenLLM lets developers run any **open-source LLMs** as **OpenAI-compatible API** endpoints with **a single command**.

- 🔬 Build for fast and production usages
- 🚂 Support llama3, qwen2, gemma, etc, and many **quantized** versions [full list](https://github.com/bentoml/openllm-models)
- ⛓️ OpenAI-compatible API
- 💬 Built-in ChatGPT like UI
- 🔥 Accelerated LLM decoding with state-of-the-art inference backends
- 🌥️ Ready for enterprise-grade cloud deployment (Kubernetes, Docker and BentoCloud)

## Installation and Setup

Install the OpenLLM package via PyPI:

```bash
pip install openllm
```

## LLM

OpenLLM supports a wide range of open-source LLMs as well as serving users' own
fine-tuned LLMs. Use `openllm model` command to see all available models that
are pre-optimized for OpenLLM.

## Wrappers

There is a OpenLLM Wrapper which supports interacting with running server with OpenLLM:

```python
from langchain_community.llms import OpenLLM
```

### Wrapper for OpenLLM server

This wrapper supports interacting with OpenLLM's OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

To run a model, do:

```bash
openllm hello
```

Wrapper usage:

```python
from langchain_community.llms import OpenLLM

llm = OpenLLM(base_url="http://localhost:3000/v1", api_key="na")

llm("What is the difference between a duck and a goose? And why there are so many Goose in Canada?")
```

### Usage

For a more detailed walkthrough of the OpenLLM Wrapper, see the
[example notebook](/docs/integrations/llms/openllm)
