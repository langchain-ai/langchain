# Cerebras

At Cerebras, we've developed the world's largest and fastest AI processor, the Wafer-Scale Engine-3 (WSE-3). The Cerebras CS-3 system, powered by the WSE-3, represents a new class of AI supercomputer that sets the standard for generative AI training and inference with unparalleled performance and scalability.

With Cerebras as your inference provider, you can:
- Achieve unprecedented speed for AI inference workloads
- Build commercially with high throughput
- Effortlessly scale your AI workloads with our seamless clustering technology

Our CS-3 systems can be quickly and easily clustered to create the largest AI supercomputers in the world, making it simple to place and run the largest models. Leading corporations, research institutions, and governments are already using Cerebras solutions to develop proprietary models and train popular open-source models.
