    "# Snowflake\n",
    "\n",
    "[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) is a cloud-based data warehousing platform that provides scalable storage and compute resources for data analytics and machine learning workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the Snowflake integration package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install langchain-snowflake-vectorstore\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also need to install the Snowflake connector:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install snowflake-connector-python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Snowflake with LangChain, you need to provide your Snowflake credentials. You can do this by setting environment variables or passing them directly to the integration classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=\"your-account\"\n",
    "export SNOWFLAKE_USER=\"your-username\"\n",
    "export SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=\"your-password\"\n",
    "export SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE=\"your-database\"\n",
    "export SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=\"your-schema\"\n",
    "export SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=\"your-warehouse\"\n",
    "export SNOWFLAKE_ROLE=\"your-role\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Direct Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also pass credentials directly when initializing Snowflake components:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_snowflake_vectorstore import SnowflakeVectorStore\n",
    "\n",
    "vector_store = SnowflakeVectorStore(\n",
    "    account=\"your-account\",\n",
    "    user=\"your-username\",\n",
    "    password=\"your-password\",\n",
    "    database=\"your-database\",\n",
    "    schema=\"your-schema\",\n",
    "    warehouse=\"your-warehouse\",\n",
    "    role=\"your-role\",\n",
    "    table_name=\"vector_documents\",\n",
    "    embedding_function=embeddings,\n",
