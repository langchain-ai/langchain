# CTranslate2

>[CTranslate2](https://opennmt.net/CTranslate2/quickstart.html) is a C++ and Python library
> for efficient inference with Transformer models.
>
>The project implements a custom runtime that applies many performance optimization
> techniques such as weights quantization, layers fusion, batch reordering, etc.,
> to accelerate and reduce the memory usage of Transformer models on CPU and GPU.
>
>A full list of features and supported models is included in the
> [projectâ€™s repository](https://opennmt.net/CTranslate2/guides/transformers.html).
> To start, please check out the official [quickstart guide](https://opennmt.net/CTranslate2/quickstart.html).
