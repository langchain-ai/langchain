# Portkey

[Portkey](https://portkey.ai) is the Control Panel for AI apps. With it's popular AI Gateway and Observability Suite, hundreds of teams ship **reliable**, **cost-efficient**, and **fast** apps.

## LLMOps for Langchain

Portkey brings production readiness to Langchain. With Portkey, you can 
- [x] Connect to 150+ models through a unified API,
- [x] View 42+ **metrics & logs** for all requests, 
- [x] Enable **semantic cache** to reduce latency & costs, 
- [x] Implement automatic **retries & fallbacks** for failed requests, 
- [x] Add **custom tags** to requests for better tracking and analysis and [more](https://portkey.ai/docs).


## Quickstart - Portkey & Langchain
Since Portkey is fully compatible with the OpenAI signature, you can connect to the Portkey AI Gateway through the `ChatOpenAI` interface.

- Set the `base_url` as `PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL`
- Add `default_headers` to consume the headers needed by Portkey using the `createHeaders` helper method.

To start, get your Portkey API key by [signing up here](https://app.portkey.ai/signup). (Click the profile icon on the bottom left, then click on "Copy API Key") or deploy the open source AI gateway in [your own environment](https://github.com/Portkey-AI/gateway/blob/main/docs/installation-deployments.md).

Next, install the Portkey SDK
```python
pip install -U portkey_ai
```

We can now connect to the Portkey AI Gateway by updating the `ChatOpenAI` model in Langchain
```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from portkey_ai import createHeaders, PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL

PORTKEY_API_KEY = "..." # Not needed when hosting your own gateway
PROVIDER_API_KEY = "..." # Add the API key of the AI provider being used 

portkey_headers = createHeaders(api_key=PORTKEY_API_KEY,provider="openai")

llm = ChatOpenAI(api_key=PROVIDER_API_KEY, base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL, default_headers=portkey_headers)

llm.invoke("What is the meaning of life, universe and everything?")
```

The request is routed through your Portkey AI Gateway to the specified `provider`. Portkey will also start logging all the requests in your account that makes debugging extremely simple.

## Using 150+ models through the AI Gateway
The power of the AI gateway comes when you're able to use the above code snippet to connect with 150+ models across 20+ providers supported through the AI gateway.

Let's modify the code above to make a call to Anthropic's `claude-3-opus-20240229` model.

Portkey supports **[Virtual Keys](https://docs.portkey.ai/docs/product/ai-gateway-streamline-llm-integrations/virtual-keys)** which are an easy way to store and manage API keys in a secure vault. Let's try using a Virtual Key to make LLM calls. You can navigate to the Virtual Keys tab in Portkey and create a new key for Anthropic.

The `virtual_key` parameter sets the authentication and provider for the AI provider being used. In our case we're using the Anthropic Virtual key.

> Notice that the `api_key` can be left blank as that authentication won't be used.

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from portkey_ai import createHeaders, PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL

PORTKEY_API_KEY = "..."
VIRTUAL_KEY = "..." # Anthropic's virtual key we copied above

portkey_headers = createHeaders(api_key=PORTKEY_API_KEY,virtual_key=VIRTUAL_KEY)

llm = ChatOpenAI(api_key="X", base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL, default_headers=portkey_headers, model="claude-3-opus-20240229")

llm.invoke("What is the meaning of life, universe and everything?")
```

The Portkey AI gateway will authenticate the API request to Anthropic and get the response back in the OpenAI format for you to consume.

The AI gateway extends Langchain's `ChatOpenAI` class making it a single interface to call any provider and any model.

## Advanced Routing - Load Balancing, Fallbacks, Retries
The Portkey AI Gateway brings capabilities like load-balancing, fallbacks, experimentation and canary testing to Langchain through a configuration-first approach.

Let's take an **example** where we might want to split traffic between `gpt-4` and `claude-opus` 50:50 to test the two large models. The gateway configuration for this would look like the following:

```python
config = {
    "strategy": {
         "mode": "loadbalance"
    },
    "targets": [{
        "virtual_key": "openai-25654", # OpenAI's virtual key
        "override_params": {"model": "gpt4"},
        "weight": 0.5
    }, {
        "virtual_key": "anthropic-25654", # Anthropic's virtual key
        "override_params": {"model": "claude-3-opus-20240229"},
        "weight": 0.5
    }]
}
```

We can then use this config in our requests being made from langchain.

```python
portkey_headers = createHeaders(
    api_key=PORTKEY_API_KEY,
    config=config
)

llm = ChatOpenAI(api_key="X", base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL, default_headers=portkey_headers)

llm.invoke("What is the meaning of life, universe and everything?")
```

When the LLM is invoked, Portkey will distribute the requests to `gpt-4` and `claude-3-opus-20240229` in the ratio of the defined weights.

You can find more config examples [here](https://docs.portkey.ai/docs/api-reference/config-object#examples).

## **Tracing Chains & Agents**

Portkey's Langchain integration gives you full visibility into the running of an agent. Let's take an example of a [popular agentic workflow](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/tool_use/quickstart/#agents).

We only need to modify the `ChatOpenAI` class to use the AI Gateway as above.

```python
from langchain import hub  
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_openai_tools_agent  
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from portkey_ai import PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL, createHeaders
 
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/openai-tools-agent")

portkey_headers = createHeaders(
    api_key=PORTKEY_API_KEY,
    virtual_key=OPENAI_VIRTUAL_KEY,
    trace_id="uuid-uuid-uuid-uuid"
)

@tool
def multiply(first_int: int, second_int: int) -> int:
    """Multiply two integers together."""
    return first_int * second_int
  
  
@tool  
def exponentiate(base: int, exponent: int) -> int:  
    "Exponentiate the base to the exponent power."  
    return base**exponent  
  
  
tools = [multiply, exponentiate]

model = ChatOpenAI(api_key="X", base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL, default_headers=portkey_headers, temperature=0)
  
# Construct the OpenAI Tools agent  
agent = create_openai_tools_agent(model, tools, prompt)

# Create an agent executor by passing in the agent and tools
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)

agent_executor.invoke({
    "input": "Take 3 to the fifth power and multiply that by thirty six, then square the result"
})
```
