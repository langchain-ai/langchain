    "When building apps or agents using Langchain, you end up making multiple API calls to fulfill a single user request. However, these requests are not chained when you want to analyse them. With [**Portkey**](/docs/integrations/providers/portkey/), all the embeddings, completions, and other requests from a single user request will get logged and traced to a common ID, enabling you to gain full visibility of user interactions.\n",
