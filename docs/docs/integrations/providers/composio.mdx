# Composio

Composio is the fastest way to enable your AI agents to take real-world actions—without dealing with individual API integrations, authentication flows, or complex tool formatting.

* **Access 3000+ tools** out of the box across popular apps like Slack, GitHub, Notion, and more. [Browse tools →](/tools/)
* **Enforce strict access and data controls** with [fine-grained permissions](/docs/authenticating-tools) for each tool and user.
* **Trigger agents and workflows** using [external events](/docs/using-triggers) (e.g., new message in Slack, new issue in GitHub).
* **Customize tools** for your proprietary APIs or internal functions via [modifiers](/docs/modifiers/schema-modifiers).
* **Integrate seamlessly** with frameworks like OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, Vercel AI SDK, and more.
* **Enhance reliability** with [input/output processing hooks](/docs/modifiers/before-execution) to clean or transform data on the fly.

No more writing dozens of bespoke integrations. Composio handles auth, tool normalization, and execution—so your agents can focus on reasoning, not plumbing.

**We even optimize tool calls automatically for better accuracy - free of cost.**
