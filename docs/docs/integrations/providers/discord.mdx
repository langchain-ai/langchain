# Discord (community loader)

>[Discord](https://discord.com/) is a VoIP and instant messaging social platform. Users have the ability to communicate 
> with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, media and files in private chats or as part of communities called 
> "servers". A server is a collection of persistent chat rooms and voice channels which can be accessed via invite links.

## Installation and Setup

```bash
pip install pandas
```

Follow these steps to download your `Discord` data:

1. Go to your **User Settings**
2. Then go to **Privacy and Safety**
3. Head over to the **Request all of my Data** and click on **Request Data** button

It might take 30 days for you to receive your data. You'll receive an email at the address which is registered 
with Discord. That email will have a download button using which you would be able to download your personal Discord data.
