# Docling

> [Docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) parses PDF, DOCX, PPTX, HTML, and other formats into a rich unified representation including document layout, tables etc., making them ready for generative AI workflows like RAG.
>
> This integration provides Docling's capabilities via the `DoclingLoader` document loader.

## Installation and Setup

Simply install `langchain-docling` from your package manager, e.g. pip:

```shell
pip install langchain-docling
```

## Document Loader

The `DoclingLoader` class in `langchain-docling` seamlessly integrates Docling into
LangChain, enabling you to:
- use various document types in your LLM applications with ease and speed, and
- leverage Docling's rich representation for advanced, document-native grounding.

Basic usage looks as follows:

```python
from langchain_docling import DoclingLoader

FILE_PATH = ["https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09869"]  # Docling Technical Report

loader = DoclingLoader(file_path=FILE_PATH)

docs = loader.load()
```
