# SemaDB

>[SemaDB](https://semafind.com/) is a no fuss vector similarity search engine. It provides a low-cost cloud hosted version to help you build AI applications with ease.

With SemaDB Cloud, our hosted version, no fuss means no pod size calculations, no schema definitions, no partition settings, no parameter tuning, no search algorithm tuning, no complex installation, no complex API. It is integrated with [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/semafind-semadb/api/semadb) providing transparent billing, automatic sharding and an interactive API playground.

## Installation

None required, get started directly with SemaDB Cloud at [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/semafind-semadb/api/semadb).

## Vector Store

There is a basic wrapper around `SemaDB` collections allowing you to use it as a vectorstore.

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import SemaDB
```

You can follow a tutorial on how to use the wrapper in [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/semadb).
