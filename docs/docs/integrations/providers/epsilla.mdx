# Epsilla

This page covers how to use [Epsilla](https://github.com/epsilla-cloud/vectordb) within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Epsilla wrappers.

## Installation and Setup

- Install the Python SDK with `pip/pip3 install pyepsilla`

## Wrappers

### VectorStore

There exists a wrapper around Epsilla vector databases, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore,
whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vectorstore:

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Epsilla
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of the Epsilla wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/epsilla.html)
