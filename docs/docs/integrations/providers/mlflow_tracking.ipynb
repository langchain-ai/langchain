    "\n",
    ">[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) is a versatile, open-source platform for managing workflows and artifacts across the machine learning lifecycle. It has built-in integrations with many popular ML libraries, but can be used with any library, algorithm, or deployment tool. It is designed to be extensible, so you can write plugins to support new workflows, libraries, and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of LangChain integration, MLflow provides the following capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow tracks and stores artifacts from your LangChain experiments, including models, code, prompts, metrics, and more.\n",
    "- **Dependency Management**: MLflow automatically records model dependencies, ensuring consistency between development and production environments.\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation** MLflow offers native capabilities for evaluating LangChain applications.\n",
    "- **Tracing**: MLflow allows you to visually trace data flows through your LangChain chain, agent, retriever, or other components.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The tracing capability is only available in MLflow versions 2.14.0 and later.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to track your LangChain experiments using MLflow. For more information about this feature and to explore tutorials and examples of using LangChain with MLflow, please refer to the [MLflow documentation for LangChain integration](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/langchain/index.html)."
