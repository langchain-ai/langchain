# Activeloop Deep Lake
This page covers how to use the Deep Lake ecosystem within LangChain.

## Why Deep Lake?
- More than just a (multi-modal) vector store. You can later use the dataset to fine-tune your own LLM models.
- Not only stores embeddings, but also the original data with automatic version control.
- Truly serverless. Doesn't require another service and can be used with major cloud providers (AWS S3, GCS, etc.)


Activeloop Deep Lake supports SelfQuery Retrieval:

## Installation and Setup
- Install the Python package with `pip install deeplake`

## Wrappers

### VectorStore

There exists a wrapper around Deep Lake, a data lake for Deep Learning applications, allowing you to use it as a vector store (for now), whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vectorstore:
```python
from langchain.vectorstores import DeepLake
```


For a more detailed walkthrough of the Deep Lake wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/activeloop_deeplake)
