**Product Documentation:** [cloud.google.com/bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable)

## Quick Start

To use this library, you first need to:

1.  Select or create a Cloud Platform project.
2.  Enable billing for your project.
3.  Enable the Google Cloud Bigtable API.
4.  Set up Authentication.

## Installation

The main package for this integration is `langchain-google-bigtable`.

```bash
pip install -U langchain-google-bigtable
```

## Integrations

The `langchain-google-bigtable` package provides the following integrations:

### Key-value Store

Use `BigtableByteStore` as a persistent, scalable key-value store for caching, session management, or other storage needs. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations.

```python
from langchain_google_bigtable import BigtableByteStore

# Initialize the store
store = await BigtableByteStore.create(
    project_id="your-project-id",
    instance_id="your-instance-id",
    table_id="your-table-id",
)

# Set and get values
await store.amset([("key1", b"value1")])
retrieved = await store.amget(["key1"])
```

Learn more in the [Key-value Store how-to guide](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/langchain-google-bigtable/latest/key-value-store).

### Document Loader

Use the `BigtableLoader` to load data from a Bigtable table and represent it as LangChain `Document` objects.

```python
from langchain_google_bigtable import BigtableLoader

loader = BigtableLoader(
    project_id="your-project-id",
    instance_id="your-instance-id",
    table_id="your-table-name"
)
docs = loader.load()
```

Learn more in the [Document Loader how-to guide](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/langchain-google-bigtable/latest/document-loader).

### Chat Message History

Use `BigtableChatMessageHistory` to store conversation histories, enabling stateful chains and agents.

```python
from langchain_google_bigtable import BigtableChatMessageHistory

history = BigtableChatMessageHistory(
    project_id="your-project-id",
    instance_id="your-instance-id",
    table_id="your-message-store",
    session_id="user-session-123"
)

history.add_user_message("Hello!")
history.add_ai_message("Hi there!")
```
