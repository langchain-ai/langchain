# Xata

> [Xata](https://xata.io) is a serverless data platform, based on `PostgreSQL`.
> It provides a Python SDK for interacting with your database, and a UI
> for managing your data.
> `Xata` has a native vector type, which can be added to any table, and
> supports similarity search. LangChain inserts vectors directly to `Xata`,
> and queries it for the nearest neighbors of a given vector, so that you can
> use all the LangChain Embeddings integrations with `Xata`.
