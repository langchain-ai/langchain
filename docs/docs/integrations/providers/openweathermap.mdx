## Wrappers

### Utility

There exists a OpenWeatherMapAPIWrapper utility which wraps this API. To import this utility:

```python
from langchain_community.utilities.openweathermap import OpenWeatherMapAPIWrapper
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of this wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/tools/openweathermap).

### Tool

You can also easily load this wrapper as a Tool (to use with an Agent).
You can do this with:

```python
import os
from langchain_community.utilities import OpenWeatherMapAPIWrapper

os.environ["OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"] = ""
weather = OpenWeatherMapAPIWrapper()
tools = [weather.run]
```

For more information on tools, see [this page](/docs/how_to/tools_builtin).
