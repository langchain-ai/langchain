## Vector Stores

### Azure Cosmos DB
AI agents can rely on Azure Cosmos DB as a unified [memory system](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/ai-agents#memory-can-make-or-break-agents) solution, enjoying speed, scale, and simplicity. This service successfully [enabled OpenAI's ChatGPT service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IIUtEFKJec&t) to scale dynamically with high reliability and low maintenance. Powered by an atom-record-sequence engine, it is the world's first globally distributed [NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/distributed-nosql), [relational](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/distributed-relational), and [vector database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/vector-database) service that offers a serverless mode. 

Below are two available Azure Cosmos DB APIs that can provide vector store functionalities.

#### Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore)

>[Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/vcore/) makes it easy to create a database with full native MongoDB support.
> You can apply your MongoDB experience and continue to use your favorite MongoDB drivers, SDKs, and tools by pointing your application to the API for MongoDB vCore account's connection string.
> Use vector search in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore to seamlessly integrate your AI-based applications with your data that's stored in Azure Cosmos DB.

##### Installation and Setup

See [detail configuration instructions](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/azure_cosmos_db).

We need to install `pymongo` python package.

```bash
pip install pymongo
```

##### Deploy Azure Cosmos DB on Microsoft Azure

Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore provides developers with a fully managed MongoDB-compatible database service for building modern applications with a familiar architecture.

With Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore, developers can enjoy the benefits of native Azure integrations, low total cost of ownership (TCO), and the familiar vCore architecture when migrating existing applications or building new ones.

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/azure_cosmos_db).

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import AzureCosmosDBVectorSearch
```

#### Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL

>[Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/vector-search) now offers vector indexing and search in preview.
This feature is designed to handle high-dimensional vectors, enabling efficient and accurate vector search at any scale. You can now store vectors
directly in the documents alongside your data. This means that each document in your database can contain not only traditional schema-free data,
but also high-dimensional vectors as other properties of the documents. This colocation of data and vectors allows for efficient indexing and searching,
as the vectors are stored in the same logical unit as the data they represent. This simplifies data management, AI application architectures, and the
efficiency of vector-based operations.

##### Installation and Setup

See [detail configuration instructions](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/azure_cosmos_db_no_sql).

We need to install `azure-cosmos` python package.

```bash
pip install azure-cosmos
```

##### Deploy Azure Cosmos DB on Microsoft Azure

Azure Cosmos DB offers a solution for modern apps and intelligent workloads by being very responsive with dynamic and elastic autoscale. It is available
in every Azure region and can automatically replicate data closer to users. It has SLA guaranteed low-latency and high availability.

Since Azure Database for PostgreSQL is open-source Postgres, you can use the [LangChain's Postgres support](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pgvector/) to connect to Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

### Azure SQL Database

>[Azure SQL Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-database-paas-overview?view=azuresql) is a robust service that combines scalability, security, and high availability, providing all the benefits of a modern database solution.  It also provides a dedicated Vector data type & built-in functions that simplifies the storage and querying of vector embeddings directly within a relational database. This eliminates the need for separate vector databases and related integrations, increasing the security of your solutions while reducing the overall complexity.

By leveraging your current SQL Server databases for vector search, you can enhance data capabilities while minimizing expenses and avoiding the challenges of transitioning to new systems.

##### Installation and Setup

See [detail configuration instructions](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/sqlserver).

We need to install the `langchain-sqlserver` python package.

```bash
!pip install langchain-sqlserver==0.1.1
```

##### Deploy Azure SQL DB on Microsoft Azure

[Sign Up](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/free-offer?view=azuresql) for free to get started today.

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/sqlserver).

```

## Retrievers

### Azure AI Search

>[Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) (formerly known as `Azure Search` or `Azure Cognitive Search` ) is a cloud search service that gives developers infrastructure, APIs, and tools for building a rich search experience over private, heterogeneous content in web, mobile, and enterprise applications.

>Search is foundational to any app that surfaces text to users, where common scenarios include catalog or document search, online retail apps, or data exploration over proprietary content. When you create a search service, you'll work with the following capabilities:
>- A search engine for full text search over a search index containing user-owned content
>- Rich indexing, with lexical analysis and optional AI enrichment for content extraction and transformation
>- Rich query syntax for text search, fuzzy search, autocomplete, geo-search and more
>- Programmability through REST APIs and client libraries in Azure SDKs
>- Azure integration at the data layer, machine learning layer, and AI (AI Services)
