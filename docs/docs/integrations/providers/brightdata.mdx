# Bright Data

[Bright Data](https://brightdata.com) is a web data platform that provides tools for web scraping, SERP collection, and accessing geo-restricted content.

Bright Data allows developers to extract structured data from websites, perform search engine queries, and access content that might be otherwise blocked or geo-restricted. The platform is designed to help overcome common web scraping challenges including anti-bot systems, CAPTCHAs, and IP blocks.

## Installation and Setup

```bash
pip install langchain-brightdata
```

You'll need to set up your Bright Data API key:

```python
import os
os.environ["BRIGHT_DATA_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
```

Or you can pass it directly when initializing tools:

```python
from langchain_bright_data import BrightDataSERP

tool = BrightDataSERP(bright_data_api_key="your-api-key")
```

## Tools

The Bright Data integration provides several tools:

- [BrightDataSERP](/docs/integrations/tools/brightdata_serp) - Search engine results collection with geo-targeting
- [BrightDataUnblocker](/docs/integrations/tools/brightdata_unlocker) - Access ANY public website that might be geo-restricted or bot-protected
- [BrightDataWebScraperAPI](/docs/integrations/tools/brightdata-webscraperapi) - Extract structured data from 100+ ppoular domains, e.g. Amazon product details and LinkedIn profiles
