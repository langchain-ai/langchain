The platform includes access to 100+ curated open-source models and supports integrations with common MLOps tools and storage frameworks.
>- [GreenNode Serverless AI:](https://greennode.ai/product/model-as-a-service) GreenNode Serverless AI features a library of pre-trained production-ready models across domains such as text gen, code gen, text to speech, speech to text, embedding and reranking models. This service is ideal for teams looking to prototype or deploy AI solutions without managing model infrastructure.
>- [AI Applications:](https://vngcloud.vn/en/solution) From intelligent data management and document processing (IDP) to smart video analytics—GreenNode supports real-world AI use cases at scale.
>Whether you're building your next LLM workflow, scaling AI research, or deploying enterprise-grade applications, **GreenNode** provides the tools and infrastructure to accelerate your journey.

## Installation and Setup

The GreenNode integration can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install langchain-greennode
```

### API Key

To use GreenNode Serverless AI, you'll need an API key which you can obtain from [GreenNode Serverless AI](https://aiplatform.console.greennode.ai/api-keys). The API key can be passed as an initialization parameter `api_key` or set as the environment variable `GREENNODE_API_KEY`.

```python
import os
os.environ["GREENNODE_API_KEY"] = "YOUR-GREENNODE-API-KEY"
```

## Chat models

```python
from langchain_greennode import ChatGreenNode

# Initialize the chat model
chat = ChatGreenNode(
    model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B",  # Choose from available models
    temperature=0.6,
    top_p=0.95
)
```

## Embedding models

```python
from langchain_greennode import GreenNodeEmbeddings

# Initialize embeddings
embeddings = GreenNodeEmbeddings(
    model="BAAI/bge-m3"  # Choose from available models
)
```

## Rerank

```python
from langchain_greennode import GreenNodeRerank

# Initialize reranker
rerank = GreenNodeRerank(
    model="BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3",  # Choose from available models
    top_n=-1
)
```
