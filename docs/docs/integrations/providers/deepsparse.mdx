# DeepSparse

This page covers how to use the [DeepSparse](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse) inference runtime within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then examples of DeepSparse usage.

## Installation and Setup

- Install the Python packages with `pip install deepsparse-nightly[llm] langchain`
- Choose a [SparseZoo model](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/?useCase=text_generation) or export a support model to ONNX [using Optimum](https://github.com/neuralmagic/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/opt-text-generation-deepsparse-quickstart/OPT_Text_Generation_DeepSparse_Quickstart.ipynb)
- Models hosted on HuggingFace are also supported by prepending `"hf:"` to the model id, such as [`"hf:mgoin/TinyStories-33M-quant-deepsparse"`](https://huggingface.co/mgoin/TinyStories-33M-quant-deepsparse)

## Using DeepSparse With LangChain

There is a DeepSparse LLM wrapper, which you can access with:

```python
from langchain.llms import DeepSparse
```

It provides a simple, unified interface for all models:

```python
from langchain.llms import DeepSparse
llm = DeepSparse(model='zoo:nlg/text_generation/codegen_mono-350m/pytorch/huggingface/bigpython_bigquery_thepile/base-none')
print(llm('def fib():'))
"""
a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

def fib2(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < n:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

def primes():
    yield 2
    it = fib()
    while True:
        try:
            yield next(it)
        except StopIteration:
            return
"""
```
## Streaming
The DeepSparse LangChain wrapper also supports per token output streaming:

```python
from langchain.llms import DeepSparse
llm = DeepSparse(
    model="hf:neuralmagic/mpt-7b-chat-pruned50-quant",
    streaming=True
)
for chunk in llm.stream("Tell me a joke", stop=["'","\n"]):
    print(chunk, end='', flush=True)
```
## Using Instruction Fine-tune Models With DeepSparse
Here's an example of how to prompt an instruction fine-tuned model using DeepSparse and the MPT-Instruct model:
```python
prompt="""
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request. ### Instruction: what is quantization? ### Response:
"""
llm = DeepSparse(model='zoo:mpt-7b-dolly_mpt_pretrain-pruned50_quantized')
print(llm(prompt))
"""
In physics, the term "quantization" refers to the process of transforming a continuous variable into a set of discrete values. In the context of quantum mechanics, this process is used to describe the restriction of the degrees of freedom of a system to a set of discrete values. In other words, it is the process of transforming the continuous spectrum of a physical quantity into a set of discrete, or "quantized", values.
"""
```
You can also do all the other things you are used to doing in LangChain such as using `PromptTemplete`s and parsing outputs:
```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.output_parsers import CommaSeparatedListOutputParser

llm_parser = CommaSeparatedListOutputParser()
llm = DeepSparse(model='hf:neuralmagic/mpt-7b-chat-pruned50-quant')

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="List how to {do}",
    input_variables=["do"])

output = llm.predict(text=prompt.format(do="Become a great software engineer"))

print(output)
"""

## Configuration

The DeepSparse LangChain integration has arguments to control the model loaded, any configs for how the model should be loaded, configs to control how tokens are generated, and then whether to return all tokens at once or to stream them one-by-one.

```python
model: str
"""The path to a model file or directory or the name of a SparseZoo model stub."""

model_config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
"""Keyword arguments passed to the pipeline construction.
Common parameters are sequence_length, prompt_sequence_length"""

generation_config: Union[None, str, Dict] = None
"""GenerationConfig dictionary consisting of parameters used to control
sequences generated for each prompt. Common parameters are:
max_length, max_new_tokens, num_return_sequences, output_scores,
top_p, top_k, repetition_penalty."""

streaming: bool = False
"""Whether to stream the results, token by token."""
```
