# DocArray

> [DocArray](https://docarray.jina.ai/) is a library for nested, unstructured, multimodal data in transit, 
> including text, image, audio, video, 3D mesh, etc. It allows deep-learning engineers to efficiently process, 
> embed, search, recommend, store, and transfer multimodal data with a Pythonic API.

```bash
pip install docarray
```
