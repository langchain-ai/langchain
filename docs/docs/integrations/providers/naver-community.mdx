## Tools

### Naver Search

The Naver Search integration allows your LangChain applications to retrieve information from Naver's search engine. This is particularly useful for Korean language queries and getting up-to-date information about Korean topics.

To use the Naver Search tools, you need to:

1. Sign in to the [Naver Developers portal](https://developers.naver.com/main/)
2. Create a new application and enable the Search API
3. Obtain your **NAVER_CLIENT_ID** and **NAVER_CLIENT_SECRET** from the "Application List" section
4. Set these as environment variables in your application

```python
from langchain_naver_community.tool import NaverSearchResults
from langchain_naver_community.utils import NaverSearchAPIWrapper

# Set up the search wrapper
search = NaverSearchAPIWrapper()

# Create a tool
tool = NaverSearchResults(api_wrapper=search)
```

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/tools/naver_search) for more details.

### Specialized Search Tools

The package also provides specialized search tools for different types of content:

```python
from langchain_naver_community.tool import NaverNewsSearch  # For news articles
from langchain_naver_community.tool import NaverBlogSearch  # For blog posts
from langchain_naver_community.tool import NaverImageSearch  # For images
```

Each of these can be used within LangChain agents to provide more targeted search capabilities.
