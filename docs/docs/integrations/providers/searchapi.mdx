# SearchApi

This page covers how to use the [SearchApi](https://www.searchapi.io/) Google Search API within LangChain. SearchApi is a real-time SERP API for easy SERP scraping.

## Setup

- Go to [https://www.searchapi.io/](https://www.searchapi.io/) to sign up for a free account
- Get the api key and set it as an environment variable (`SEARCHAPI_API_KEY`)

## Wrappers

### Utility

There is a SearchApiAPIWrapper utility which wraps this API. To import this utility:

```python
from langchain_community.utilities import SearchApiAPIWrapper
```

You can use it as part of a Self Ask chain:

```python
from langchain_community.utilities import SearchApiAPIWrapper
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.agents import AgentType

import os

os.environ["SEARCHAPI_API_KEY"] = ""
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = ""

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
search = SearchApiAPIWrapper()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Intermediate Answer",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to ask with search"
    )
]

self_ask_with_search = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.SELF_ASK_WITH_SEARCH, verbose=True)
self_ask_with_search.run("Who lived longer: Plato, Socrates, or Aristotle?")
```

#### Output

```
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
 Yes.
Follow up: How old was Plato when he died?
Intermediate answer: eighty
Follow up: How old was Socrates when he died?
Intermediate answer: | Socrates | 
| -------- | 
| Born | c. 470 BC Deme Alopece, Athens | 
| Died | 399 BC (aged approximately 71) Athens | 
| Cause of death | Execution by forced suicide by poisoning | 
| Spouse(s) | Xanthippe, Myrto | 

Follow up: How old was Aristotle when he died?
Intermediate answer: 62 years
So the final answer is: Plato

> Finished chain.
'Plato'
```

### Tool

You can also easily load this wrapper as a Tool (to use with an Agent).
You can do this with:

```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits.load_tools import load_tools
tools = load_tools(["searchapi"])
```

For more information on tools, see [this page](/docs/how_to/tools_builtin).
