# CogniSwitch

>[CogniSwitch](https://www.cogniswitch.ai/aboutus) is an API based data platform that
> enhances enterprise data by extracting entities, concepts and their relationships
> thereby converting this data into a multidimensional format and storing it in
> a database that can accommodate these enhancements. In our case the data is stored
> in a knowledge graph. This enhanced data is now ready for consumption by LLMs and
> other GenAI applications ensuring the data is consumable and context can be maintained.
> Thereby eliminating hallucinations and delivering accuracy.
