# Linkup

> [Linkup](https://www.linkup.so/) provides an API to connect LLMs to the web and the Linkup Premium Partner sources.

## Installation and Setup

To use the Linkup provider, you first need a valid API key, which you can find by signing-up [here](https://app.linkup.so/sign-up).
You will also need the `langchain-linkup` package, which you can install using pip:

```bash
pip install langchain-linkup
```

## Retriever

```python
from langchain_linkup import LinkupSearchRetriever

retriever = LinkupSearchRetriever(
    depth="deep",  # "standard" or "deep"
    linkup_api_key=None,  # API key can be passed here or set as the LINKUP_API_KEY environment variable
)
```

## Tools
