## Available Tools

Hyperbrowser provides two main categories of tools that are particularly useful for:
- Web scraping and data extraction from complex websites
- Automating repetitive web tasks
- Interacting with web applications that require authentication
- Performing research across multiple websites
- Testing web applications

### Browser Agent Tools

Hyperbrowser provides a number of Browser Agents tools. Currently we supported
 - Claude Computer Use
 - OpenAI CUA
 - Browser Use

You can see more details [here](/docs/integrations/tools/hyperbrowser_browser_agent_tools) 

#### Browser Use Tool
A general-purpose browser automation tool that can handle various web tasks through natural language instructions.

```python
from langchain_hyperbrowser import HyperbrowserBrowserUseTool

tool = HyperbrowserBrowserUseTool()
result = tool.run({
    "task": "Go to npmjs.com, find the React package, and tell me when it was last updated"
})
print(result)
```

#### OpenAI CUA Tool
Leverages OpenAI's Computer Use Agent capabilities for advanced web interactions and information gathering.

```python
from langchain_hyperbrowser import HyperbrowserOpenAICUATool

tool = HyperbrowserOpenAICUATool()
result = tool.run({
    "task": "Go to Hacker News and summarize the top 5 posts right now"
})
print(result)
```

#### Claude Computer Use Tool
Utilizes Anthropic's Claude for sophisticated web browsing and information processing tasks.

```python
from langchain_hyperbrowser import HyperbrowserClaudeComputerUseTool

tool = HyperbrowserClaudeComputerUseTool()
result = tool.run({
    "task": "Go to GitHub's trending repositories page, and list the top 3 posts there right now"
})
print(result)
```

### Web Scraping Tools

Here is a brief description of the Web Scraping Tools available with Hyperbrowser. You can see more details [here](/docs/integrations/tools/hyperbrowser_web_scraping_tools)

#### Scrape Tool
The Scrape Tool allows you to extract content from a single webpage in markdown, HTML, or link format.

```python
from langchain_hyperbrowser import HyperbrowserScrapeTool

tool = HyperbrowserScrapeTool()
result = tool.run({
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "scrape_options": {"formats": ["markdown"]}
})
print(result)
```

#### Crawl Tool
The Crawl Tool enables you to traverse entire websites, starting from a given URL, with configurable page limits.

```python
from langchain_hyperbrowser import HyperbrowserCrawlTool

tool = HyperbrowserCrawlTool()
result = tool.run({
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "max_pages": 2,
    "scrape_options": {"formats": ["markdown"]}
})
print(result)
```

#### Extract Tool
The Extract Tool uses AI to pull structured data from web pages based on predefined schemas, making it perfect for data extraction tasks.

```python
from langchain_hyperbrowser import HyperbrowserExtractTool
from pydantic import BaseModel

class SimpleExtractionModel(BaseModel):
    title: str

tool = HyperbrowserExtractTool()
result = tool.run({
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "schema": SimpleExtractionModel
})
print(result)
```

## Document Loader

The `HyperbrowserLoader` class in `langchain-hyperbrowser` can easily be used to load content from any single page or multiple pages as well as crawl an entire site.
The content can be loaded as markdown or html.

```python
from langchain_hyperbrowser import HyperbrowserLoader

loader = HyperbrowserLoader(urls="https://example.com")
docs = loader.load()

print(docs[0])
```

### Advanced Usage

You can specify the operation to be performed by the loader. The default operation is `scrape`. For `scrape`, you can provide a single URL or a list of URLs to be scraped. For `crawl`, you can only provide a single URL. The `crawl` operation will crawl the provided page and subpages and return a document for each page.

```python
loader = HyperbrowserLoader(
  urls="https://hyperbrowser.ai", api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", operation="crawl"
)
```

Optional params for the loader can also be provided in the `params` argument. For more information on the supported params, visit https://docs.hyperbrowser.ai/reference/sdks/python/scrape#start-scrape-job-and-wait or https://docs.hyperbrowser.ai/reference/sdks/python/crawl#start-crawl-job-and-wait.

```python
loader = HyperbrowserLoader(
  urls="https://example.com",
  api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
  operation="scrape",
  params={"scrape_options": {"include_tags": ["h1", "h2", "p"]}}
)
```
