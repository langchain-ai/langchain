    "`DatabricksEmbeddings` class wraps an embedding model endpoint hosted on [Databricks Model Serving](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/index.html). This example notebook shows how to wrap your serving endpoint and use it as a embedding model in your LangChain application.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Endpoint Requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "The serving endpoint `DatabricksEmbeddings` wraps must have OpenAI-compatible embedding input/output format ([reference](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/deployments/index.html#embeddings)). As long as the input format is compatible, `DatabricksEmbeddings` can be used for any endpoint type hosted on [Databricks Model Serving](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/index.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Foundation Models - Curated list of state-of-the-art foundation models such as BAAI General Embedding (BGE). These endpoint are ready to use in your Databricks workspace without any set up.\n",
    "2. Custom Models - You can also deploy custom embedding models to a serving endpoint via MLflow with\n",
    "your choice of framework such as LangChain, Pytorch, Transformers, etc.\n",
    "3. External Models - Databricks endpoints can serve models that are hosted outside Databricks as a proxy, such as proprietary model service like OpenAI text-embedding-3.\n"
