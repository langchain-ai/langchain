    "# Local BGE Embeddings with IPEX-LLM on Intel GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "> [IPEX-LLM](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm) is a PyTorch library for running LLM on Intel CPU and GPU (e.g., local PC with iGPU, discrete GPU such as Arc, Flex and Max) with very low latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example goes over how to use LangChain to conduct embedding tasks with `ipex-llm` optimizations on Intel GPU. This would be helpful in applications such as RAG, document QA, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> It is recommended that only Windows users with Intel Arc A-Series GPU (except for Intel Arc A300-Series or Pro A60) run this Jupyter notebook directly. For other cases (e.g. Linux users, Intel iGPU, etc.), it is recommended to run the code with Python scripts in terminal for best experiences.\n",
