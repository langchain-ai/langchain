    "\n",
    "This notebook showcases the UpTrain callback handler seamlessly integrating into your pipeline, facilitating diverse evaluations. We have chosen a few evaluations that we deemed apt for evaluating the chains. These evaluations run automatically, with results displayed in the output. More details on UpTrain's evaluations can be found [here](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain?tab=readme-ov-file#pre-built-evaluations-we-offer-). \n",

    "Selected retrievers from Langchain are highlighted for demonstration:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Vanilla RAG**:\n",
    "RAG plays a crucial role in retrieving context and generating responses. To ensure its performance and response quality, we conduct the following evaluations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Context Relevance](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/context-awareness/context-relevance)**: Determines if the context extracted from the query is relevant to the response.\n",
    "- **[Factual Accuracy](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/context-awareness/factual-accuracy)**: Assesses if the LLM is hallcuinating or providing incorrect information.\n",
    "- **[Response Completeness](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/response-quality/response-completeness)**: Checks if the response contains all the information requested by the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Multi Query Generation**:\n",
    "MultiQueryRetriever creates multiple variants of a question having a similar meaning to the original question. Given the complexity, we include the previous evaluations and add:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Multi Query Accuracy](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/query-quality/multi-query-accuracy)**: Assures that the multi-queries generated mean the same as the original query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Context Compression and Reranking**:\n",
    "Re-ranking involves reordering nodes based on relevance to the query and choosing top n nodes. Since the number of nodes can reduce once the re-ranking is complete, we perform the following evaluations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Context Reranking](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/context-awareness/context-reranking)**: Checks if the order of re-ranked nodes is more relevant to the query than the original order.\n",
    "- **[Context Conciseness](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/context-awareness/context-conciseness)**: Examines whether the reduced number of nodes still provides all the required information.\n",
    "\n",
    "These evaluations collectively ensure the robustness and effectiveness of the RAG, MultiQueryRetriever, and the Reranking process in the chain."

    "1. Observability and real-time monitoring of production data\n",
    "1. Regression testing via seamless integration with your CI/CD pipelines\n",

    "You can choose between the following options for evaluating using UpTrain:\n",
    "### 1. **UpTrain's Open-Source Software (OSS)**: \n",
    "You can use the open-source evaluation service to evaluate your model. In this case, you will need to provie an OpenAI API key. UpTrain uses the GPT models to evaluate the responses generated by the LLM. You can get yours [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to view your evaluations in the UpTrain dashboard, you will need to set it up by running the following commands in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain\n",
    "cd uptrain\n",
    "bash run_uptrain.sh\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 2. **UpTrain Managed Service and Dashboards**:\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use UpTrain's managed service to evaluate your model. You can create a free UpTrain account [here](https://uptrain.ai/) and get free trial credits. If you want more trial credits, [book a call with the maintainers of UpTrain here](https://calendly.com/uptrain-sourabh/30min).\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of using the managed service are:\n",
    "1. No need to set up the UpTrain dashboard on your local machine.\n",
