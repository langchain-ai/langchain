    "[Weave](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/) is designed to make tracking and logging all calls made through the [LangChain Python library](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) effortless.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with LLMs, debugging is inevitable. Whether a model call fails, an output is misformatted, or nested model calls create confusion, pinpointing issues can be challenging. LangChain applications often consist of multiple steps and LLM call invocations, making it crucial to understand the inner workings of your chains and agents.\n",

    "Weave simplifies this process by automatically capturing traces for your [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) applications. This enables you to monitor and analyze your application's performance, making it easier to debug and optimize your LLM workflows."

    "\n",
    "The manual logging methods (`WeaveTracer` and `weave_tracing_enabled`) are similar to using request callbacks in individual parts of a LangChain application. These methods provide finer control over which parts of your application are traced:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constructor Callbacks:** Applied to the entire chain or component, logging all interactions consistently.\n",
    "- **Request Callbacks:** Applied to specific requests, allowing detailed tracing of particular invocations.\n",

    "Organizing and evaluating LLMs in applications for various use cases is challenging with multiple components, such as prompts, model configurations, and inference parameters.
