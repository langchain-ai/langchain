Editing a Documentation Page on GitHub
Sometimes you want to make a small change—like fixing a typo—and the easiest way to do this is to use GitHub's editor directly.

Steps
Navigate to the documentation page in the LangChain docs:

At the bottom of the documentation page, find the green "Edit this page" link.

Click the link to be directed to the GitHub editor.

If the file you’re editing is a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) instead of a Markdown (.md, .mdx) file, follow the steps in section 3.

Fork the repository:

If you haven't already, GitHub will prompt you to fork the repository to your account.

Make sure to fork the repository into your personal account—not an organization (why?).

Click "Fork this repository" to create a copy of the repository under your account.

After forking, you will automatically be redirected to the correct editor.

Make your changes:

Edit the documentation directly in the GitHub editor to correct the typo.

Commit your changes:

Click the "Commit changes..." button at the top right corner of the page.

Provide a commit title, such as "Fix typo in X section."

Optionally add a detailed description.

Click "Propose changes."

Submit a pull request (PR):

GitHub will redirect you to a page where you can create a pull request.

Review your proposed changes to ensure everything is correct.

Click "Create pull request."

Give your PR a clear title, such as docs: Fix typo in X section.

Follow any checklist in the PR description template.

Getting a Review
After submitting the pull request, it will be reviewed by the maintainers. You may receive feedback or requests for changes. Monitor the PR for any comments and address them as needed.

Documentation PRs are typically reviewed within a few days, though it may take longer depending on the complexity of the change and the availability of maintainers.

For more information, refer to the Review Process.
