# How to bootstrap a new integration package

This guide walks through the process of publishing a new LangChain integration 
package to PyPi.

Integration packages are just Python packages that can be installed with `pip install <your-package>`,
which contain classes that are compatible with LangChain's core interfaces.

In this guide, we will be using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for
dependency management and packaging, and you're welcome to use any other tools you prefer.

## **Prerequisites**

- [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) account

## Boostrapping a new Python package with Poetry

First, install Poetry:

```bash
pip install poetry
```

Next, come up with a name for your package. For this guide, we'll use `langchain-parrot-link`.
You can confirm that the name is available on PyPi by searching for it on the [PyPi website](https://pypi.org/).

Next, create your new Python package with Poetry:

```bash
poetry new langchain-parrot-link
```

Add main dependencies using Poetry, which will add them to your `pyproject.toml` file:

```bash
poetry add langchain-core
```

We will also add some `test` dependencies in a separate poetry dependency group. If
you are not using Poetry, we recommend adding these in a way that won't package them
with your published package, or just installing them separately when you run tests.

`langchain-tests` will provide the [standard tests](./standard_tests) we will use later. 
We recommended pinning these to the latest version: <img src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/langchain-tests" style={{position:"relative",top:4,left:3}} />

Note: Replace `{latest version}` with the latest version of `langchain-tests` below.

```bash
poetry add --group test pytest pytest-socket langchain-tests=={latest version}
```

You're now ready to start writing your integration package!

## Writing your integration

Let's say you're building a simple integration package that provides a `ChatParrotLink`
chat model integration for LangChain. Here's a simple example of what your project
structure might look like:

```plaintext
langchain-parrot-link/
├── langchain_parrot_link/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── chat_models.py
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── test_chat_models.py
├── pyproject.toml
└── README.md
```

All of these files should already exist from step 1, except for 
`chat_models.py` and `test_chat_models.py`! We will implement `test_chat_models.py` 
later, following the [standard tests](./standard_tests) guide.

To implement `chat_models.py`, let's copy the implementation from our
[Custom Chat Model Guide](../../../../how_to/custom_chat_model).

    When contributing an implementation to LangChain, carefully document
    the model including the initialization parameters, include
    an example of how to initialize the model and include any relevant
    links to the underlying models documentation or API.

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

## Next Steps

Now that you've implemented your package, you can move on to [testing your integration](../standard_tests) for your integration and successfully run them.
