We are \"condemned to be free\" because we cannot escape making choices and taking responsibility for our choices. \\n\\n- De Beauvoir felt that many people evade their freedom and responsibility by adopting rigid mindsets, ideologies, or conforming uncritically to social roles.\\n\\n- She advocated for the recognition of ambiguity in the human condition and warned against the quest for absolute rules that deny freedom and responsibility.
