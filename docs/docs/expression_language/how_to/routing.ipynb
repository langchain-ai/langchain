    "\n",
    "Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to perform routing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using a `RunnableBranch`.\n",
    "2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain."

To use LangChain, you simply type or speak your input and LangChain will respond. \\n\\nYou can ask LangChain questions, have discussions, get summaries or explanations about topics, and request it to generate text on a subject. Some examples of interactions:\\n\\n- Ask general knowledge questions and LangChain will try to answer factually. For example \"What is the capital of France?\"\\n\\n- Have conversations on topics by taking turns speaking. You can prompt the start of a conversation by saying something like \"Let\\'s discuss machine learning\"\\n\\n- Ask for summaries or high-level explanations on subjects. For example \"Can you summarize the main themes in Shakespeare\\'s Hamlet?\" \\n\\n- Give creative writing prompts or requests to have LangChain generate text in different styles. For example \"Write a short children\\'s story about a mouse\" or \"Generate a poem in the style of Robert Frost about nature\"\\n\\n- Correct LangChain if it makes an inaccurate statement and provide the right information.
