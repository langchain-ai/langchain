# Toolkits


Toolkits are collections of tools that are designed to be used together for specific tasks. They have convenient loading methods.
For a complete list of available ready-made toolkits, visit [Integrations](/docs/integrations/toolkits/).

All Toolkits expose a `get_tools` method which returns a list of tools.
You can therefore do:

```python
# Initialize a toolkit
toolkit = ExampleTookit(...)

# Get list of tools
tools = toolkit.get_tools()

# Create agent
agent = create_agent_method(llm, tools, prompt)
```
