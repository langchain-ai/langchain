# NGram overlap example selector

The NGramOverlapExampleSelector selects and orders examples based on which examples are most similar to the input, according to an ngram overlap score. The ngram overlap score is a float between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. 

The selector allows for a threshold score to be set. Examples with an ngram overlap score less than or equal to the threshold are excluded. The threshold is set to -1.0, by default, so will not exclude any examples, only reorder them. Setting the threshold to 0.0 will exclude examples that have no ngram overlaps with the input.
