# Maximal marginal relevance example selector

The MaxMarginalRelevanceExampleSelector selects examples based on a combination of which examples are most similar to the inputs, while also optimizing for diversity. It does this by finding the examples with the embeddings that have the greatest cosine similarity with the inputs, and then iteratively adding them while penalizing them for closeness to already selected examples.
