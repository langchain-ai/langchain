# GooseAI

`GooseAI` is a fully managed NLP-as-a-Service, delivered via API. GooseAI provides access to [these models](https://goose.ai/docs/models).

This notebook goes over how to use Langchain with [GooseAI](https://goose.ai/).

## Install openai
The `openai` package is required to use the GooseAI API. Install `openai` using `pip3 install openai`.


```python
$ pip3 install openai
```

## Imports


```python
import os
from langchain.llms import GooseAI
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain
```

## Set the Environment API Key
Make sure to get your API key from GooseAI. You are given $10 in free credits to test different models.


```python
from getpass import getpass

GOOSEAI_API_KEY = getpass()
```


```python
os.environ["GOOSEAI_API_KEY"] = GOOSEAI_API_KEY
```

## Create the GooseAI instance
You can specify different parameters such as the model name, max tokens generated, temperature, etc.


```python
llm = GooseAI()
```

## Create a Prompt Template
We will create a prompt template for Question and Answer.


```python
template = """Question: {question}

Answer: Let's think step by step."""

prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["question"])
```

## Initiate the LLMChain


```python
llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)
```

## Run the LLMChain
Provide a question and run the LLMChain.


```python
question = "What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Beiber was born?"

llm_chain.run(question)
```
