# StochasticAI

>[Stochastic Acceleration Platform](https://docs.stochastic.ai/docs/introduction/) aims to simplify the life cycle of a Deep Learning model. From uploading and versioning the model, through training, compression and acceleration to putting it into production.

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with `StochasticAI` models.
