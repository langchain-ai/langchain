# MosaicML

[MosaicML](https://docs.mosaicml.com/en/latest/inference.html) offers a managed inference service. You can either use a variety of open source models, or deploy your own.

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with MosaicML Inference for text completion.

```python
llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)
```


```python
question = "What is one good reason why you should train a large language model on domain specific data?"

llm_chain.run(question)
