# Structured Decoding with RELLM

[RELLM](https://github.com/r2d4/rellm) is a library that wraps local Hugging Face pipeline models for structured decoding.

It works by generating tokens one at a time. At each step, it masks tokens that don't conform to the provided partial regular expression.

```

### Hugging Face Baseline

First, let's establish a qualitative baseline by checking the output of the model without structured decoding.


```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)
prompt = """Human: "What's the capital of the United States?"
AI Assistant:{
  "action": "Final Answer",
  "action_input": "The capital of the United States is Washington D.C."
}
Human: "What's the capital of Pennsylvania?"
AI Assistant:{
  "action": "Final Answer",
  "action_input": "The capital of Pennsylvania is Harrisburg."
}
Human: "What 2 + 5?"
AI Assistant:{
  "action": "Final Answer",
  "action_input": "2 + 5 = 7."
}
Human: 'What's the capital of Maryland?'
AI Assistant:"""
```


```python
from transformers import pipeline
from langchain.llms import HuggingFacePipeline

hf_model = pipeline("text-generation", model="cerebras/Cerebras-GPT-590M", max_new_tokens=200)

original_model = HuggingFacePipeline(pipeline=hf_model)

generated = original_model.generate([prompt], stop=["Human:"])
print(generated)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.


    generations=[[Generation(text=' "What\'s the capital of Maryland?"\n', generation_info=None)]] llm_output=None
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

***That's not so impressive, is it? It didn't answer the question and it didn't follow the JSON format at all! Let's try with the structured decoder.***

## RELLM LLM Wrapper

Let's try that again, now providing a regex to match the JSON structured format.


```python
import regex # Note this is the regex library NOT python's re stdlib module

# We'll choose a regex that matches to a structured json string that looks like:
# {
#  "action": "Final Answer",
# "action_input": string or dict
# }
pattern = regex.compile(r'\{\s*"action":\s*"Final Answer",\s*"action_input":\s*(\{.*\}|"[^"]*")\s*\}\nHuman:')
```


```python
from langchain.experimental.llms import RELLM

model = RELLM(pipeline=hf_model, regex=pattern, max_new_tokens=200)

generated = model.predict(prompt, stop=["Human:"])
print(generated)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {"action": "Final Answer",
      "action_input": "The capital of Maryland is Baltimore."
    }
    
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

**Voila! Free of parsing errors.**
