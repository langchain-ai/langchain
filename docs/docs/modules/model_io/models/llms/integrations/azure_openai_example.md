# Azure OpenAI

This notebook goes over how to use Langchain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).

The Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.

## API configuration
You can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:

```bash
# Set this to `azure`
export OPENAI_API_TYPE=azure
# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-03-15-preview` for the released version.
export OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-03-15-preview
# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com
# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>
```

Alternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_TYPE"] = "azure"
...
```

## Deployments
With Azure OpenAI, you set up your own deployments of the common GPT-3 and Codex models.  When calling the API, you need to specify the deployment you want to use.

Let's say your deployment name is `text-davinci-002-prod`.  In the `openai` Python API, you can specify this deployment with the `engine` parameter.  For example:

```python
import openai

response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-002-prod",
    prompt="This is a test",
    max_tokens=5
)
```

```bash
pip install openai
```


```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_TYPE"] = "azure"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_VERSION"] = "2023-03-15-preview"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_BASE"] = "..."
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "..."
```


```python
# Import Azure OpenAI
from langchain.llms import AzureOpenAI
```


```python
# Create an instance of Azure OpenAI
# Replace the deployment name with your own
llm = AzureOpenAI(
    deployment_name="td2",
    model_name="text-davinci-002", 
)
```


```python
# Run the LLM
llm("Tell me a joke")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    "\n\nWhy couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? Because it was...two tired!"
```

We can also print the LLM and see its custom print.


```python
print(llm)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    AzureOpenAI
    Params: {'deployment_name': 'text-davinci-002', 'model_name': 'text-davinci-002', 'temperature': 0.7, 'max_tokens': 256, 'top_p': 1, 'frequency_penalty': 0, 'presence_penalty': 0, 'n': 1, 'best_of': 1}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>
