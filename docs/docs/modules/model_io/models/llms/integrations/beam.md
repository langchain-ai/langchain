# Beam integration for langchain

Calls the Beam API wrapper to deploy and make subsequent calls to an instance of the gpt2 LLM in a cloud deployment. Requires installation of the Beam library and registration of Beam Client ID and Client Secret. By calling the wrapper an instance of the model is created and run, with returned text relating to the prompt. Additional calls can then be made by directly calling the Beam API.

Install the Beam CLI


```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slai-labs/get-beam/main/get-beam.sh -sSfL | sh
```

Register API Keys and set your beam client id and secret environment variables:


```bash
import os
import subprocess

beam_client_id = "<Your beam client id>"
beam_client_secret = "<Your beam client secret>"

# Set the environment variables
os.environ['BEAM_CLIENT_ID'] = beam_client_id
os.environ['BEAM_CLIENT_SECRET'] = beam_client_secret

# Run the beam configure command
beam configure --clientId={beam_client_id} --clientSecret={beam_client_secret}
```

Install the Beam SDK:


```bash
pip install beam-sdk
```

**Deploy and call Beam directly from langchain!**

Note that a cold start might take a couple of minutes to return the response, but subsequent calls will be faster!


```python
from langchain.llms.beam import Beam

llm = Beam(model_name="gpt2",
           name="langchain-gpt2-test",
           cpu=8,
           memory="32Gi",
           gpu="A10G",
           python_version="python3.8",
           python_packages=[
               "diffusers[torch]>=0.10",
               "transformers",
               "torch",
               "pillow",
               "accelerate",
               "safetensors",
               "xformers",],
           max_length="50",
           verbose=False)

llm._deploy()

response = llm._call("Running machine learning on a remote GPU")

print(response)
```
