# GPT4All

[GitHub:nomic-ai/gpt4all](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) an ecosystem of open-source chatbots trained on a massive collections of clean assistant data including code, stories and dialogue.

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with `GPT4All` models.

```python
%pip install gpt4all > /dev/null
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain
from langchain.llms import GPT4All
from langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler
```


```python
template = """Question: {question}

Answer: Let's think step by step."""

prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["question"])
```

### Specify Model

To run locally, download a compatible ggml-formatted model. For more info, visit https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all

For full installation instructions go [here](https://gpt4all.io/index.html).

The GPT4All Chat installer needs to decompress a 3GB LLM model during the installation process!

Note that new models are uploaded regularly - check the link above for the most recent `.bin` URL


```python
local_path = './models/ggml-gpt4all-l13b-snoozy.bin'  # replace with your desired local file path
```

Uncomment the below block to download a model. You may want to update `url` to a new version.


```python
# import requests

# from pathlib import Path
# from tqdm import tqdm

# Path(local_path).parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

# # Example model. Check https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all for the latest models.
# url = 'http://gpt4all.io/models/ggml-gpt4all-l13b-snoozy.bin'

# # send a GET request to the URL to download the file. Stream since it's large
# response = requests.get(url, stream=True)

# # open the file in binary mode and write the contents of the response to it in chunks
# # This is a large file, so be prepared to wait.
# with open(local_path, 'wb') as f:
#     for chunk in tqdm(response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192)):
#         if chunk:
#             f.write(chunk)
```


```python
# Callbacks support token-wise streaming
callbacks = [StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()]
# Verbose is required to pass to the callback manager
llm = GPT4All(model=local_path, callbacks=callbacks, verbose=True)
# If you want to use a custom model add the backend parameter
# Check https://docs.gpt4all.io/gpt4all_python.html for supported backends
llm = GPT4All(model=local_path, backend='gptj', callbacks=callbacks, verbose=True)
```


```python
llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)
```


```python
question = "What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Bieber was born?"

llm_chain.run(question)
```
