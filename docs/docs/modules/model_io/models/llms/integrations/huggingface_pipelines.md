# Hugging Face Local Pipelines

Hugging Face models can be run locally through the `HuggingFacePipeline` class.

The [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) hosts over 120k models, 20k datasets, and 50k demo apps (Spaces), all open source and publicly available, in an online platform where people can easily collaborate and build ML together.

These can be called from LangChain either through this local pipeline wrapper or by calling their hosted inference endpoints through the HuggingFaceHub class. For more information on the hosted pipelines, see the [HuggingFaceHub](huggingface_hub.ipynb) notebook.

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->

To use, you should have the ``transformers`` python [package installed](https://pypi.org/project/transformers/).


```bash
pip install transformers > /dev/null
```

### Load the model


```python
from langchain import HuggingFacePipeline

llm = HuggingFacePipeline.from_model_id(model_id="bigscience/bloom-1b7", task="text-generation", model_kwargs={"temperature":0, "max_length":64})
```

```

</CodeOutputBlock>

### Integrate the model in an LLMChain


```python
from langchain import PromptTemplate,  LLMChain

template = """Question: {question}

Answer: Let's think step by step."""
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["question"])

llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)

question = "What is electroencephalography?"

print(llm_chain.run(question))
```

This behaviour is deprecated and will be removed from the config in v5 of Transformers -- we recommend using `max_new_tokens` to control the maximum length of the generation.

     First, we need to understand what is an electroencephalogram. An electroencephalogram is a recording of brain activity. It is a recording of brain activity that is made by placing electrodes on the scalp. The electrodes are placed
