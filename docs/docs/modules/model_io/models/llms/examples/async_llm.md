# Async API

LangChain provides async support for LLMs by leveraging the [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) library.

Async support is particularly useful for calling multiple LLMs concurrently, as these calls are network-bound. Currently, `OpenAI`, `PromptLayerOpenAI`, `ChatOpenAI` and `Anthropic` are supported, but async support for other LLMs is on the roadmap.

You can use the `agenerate` method to call an OpenAI LLM asynchronously.

```python
import time
import asyncio

from langchain.llms import OpenAI

def generate_serially():
    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)
    for _ in range(10):
        resp = llm.generate(["Hello, how are you?"])
        print(resp.generations[0][0].text)


async def async_generate(llm):
    resp = await llm.agenerate(["Hello, how are you?"])
    print(resp.generations[0][0].text)


async def generate_concurrently():
    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)
    tasks = [async_generate(llm) for _ in range(10)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)


s = time.perf_counter()
# If running this outside of Jupyter, use asyncio.run(generate_concurrently())
await generate_concurrently() 
elapsed = time.perf_counter() - s
print('\033[1m' + f"Concurrent executed in {elapsed:0.2f} seconds." + '\033[0m')

s = time.perf_counter()
generate_serially()
elapsed = time.perf_counter() - s
print('\033[1m' + f"Serial executed in {elapsed:0.2f} seconds." + '\033[0m')
```
