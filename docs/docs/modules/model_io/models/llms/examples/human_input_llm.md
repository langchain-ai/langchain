# Human input LLM

Similar to the fake LLM, LangChain provides a pseudo LLM class that can be used for testing, debugging, or educational purposes. This allows you to mock out calls to the LLM and simulate how a human would respond if they received the prompts.

In this notebook, we go over how to use this.

We start this with using the HumanInputLLM in an agent.

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->


```python
from langchain.llms.human import HumanInputLLM
```


```python
from langchain.agents import load_tools
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType
```

Since we will use the `WikipediaQueryRun` tool in this notebook, you might need to install the `wikipedia` package if you haven't done so already.


```python
%pip install wikipedia
```


```python
tools = load_tools(["wikipedia"])
llm = HumanInputLLM(prompt_func=lambda prompt: print(f"\n===PROMPT====\n{prompt}\n=====END OF PROMPT======"))
```


```python
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)
```


```python
agent.run("What is 'Bocchi the Rock!'?")
```
