# Sentence Transformers Embeddings

[SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/) embeddings are called using the `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` integration. We have also added an alias for `SentenceTransformerEmbeddings` for users who are more familiar with directly using that package.

SentenceTransformers is a python package that can generate text and image embeddings, originating from [Sentence-BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084)
