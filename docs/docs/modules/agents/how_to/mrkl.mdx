# Replicating MRKL

This walkthrough demonstrates how to replicate the [MRKL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00445.pdf) system using agents.

This uses the example Chinook database.
To set it up follow the instructions on https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/, placing the `.db` file in a notebooks folder at the root of this repository.

```python
from langchain.chains import LLMMathChain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper
from langchain.utilities import SQLDatabase
from langchain_experimental.sql import SQLDatabaseChain
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.agents import AgentType
```


```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
search = SerpAPIWrapper()
llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm, verbose=True)
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///../../../../../notebooks/Chinook.db")
db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True)
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Search",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. You should ask targeted questions"
    ),
    Tool(
        name="Calculator",
        func=llm_math_chain.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about math"
    ),
    Tool(
        name="FooBar DB",
        func=db_chain.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about FooBar. Input should be in the form of a question containing full context"
    )
]
```


```python
mrkl = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)
```


```python
mrkl.run("Who is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?")
```

     I need to find out who Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend is and then calculate her age raised to the 0.43 power.
    Action: Search
    Action Input: "Who is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend?"
    Observation: DiCaprio met actor Camila Morrone in December 2017, when she was 20 and he was 43. They were spotted at Coachella and went on multiple vacations together. Some reports suggested that DiCaprio was ready to ask Morrone to marry him. The couple made their red carpet debut at the 2020 Academy Awards.
    Thought: I need to calculate Camila Morrone's age raised to the 0.43 power.
    Action: Calculator
    Action Input: 21^0.43

    > Entering new LLMMathChain chain...
    21^0.43
    ```text
    21**0.43
    ```
    ...numexpr.evaluate("21**0.43")...

    Answer: 3.7030049853137306
    > Finished chain.

    Observation: Answer: 3.7030049853137306
    Thought: I now know the final answer.
    Final Answer: Camila Morrone is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend and her current age raised to the 0.43 power is 3.7030049853137306.

    > Finished chain.


    "Camila Morrone is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend and her current age raised to the 0.43 power is 3.7030049853137306."

     I need to find out the artist's full name and then search the FooBar database for their albums.
    Action: Search
    Action Input: "The Storm Before the Calm" artist
    Observation: The Storm Before the Calm (stylized in all lowercase) is the tenth (and eighth international) studio album by Canadian-American singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released June 17, 2022, via Epiphany Music and Thirty Tigers, as well as by RCA Records in Europe.
    Thought: I now need to search the FooBar database for Alanis Morissette's albums.
    Action: FooBar DB
    Action Input: What albums by Alanis Morissette are in the FooBar database?

## With a chat model

```python

db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///../../../../../notebooks/Chinook.db")
db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm1, db, verbose=True)
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Search",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. You should ask targeted questions"
    ),
    Tool(
        name="Calculator",
        func=llm_math_chain.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about math"
    ),

        func=db_chain.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about FooBar. Input should be in the form of a question containing full context"

```python

```

    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    Thought: The first question requires a search, while the second question requires a calculator.
    Action:

    Observation: Gigi Hadid: 2022 Leo and Gigi were first linked back in September 2022, when a source told Us Weekly that Leo had his “sights set" on her (alarming way to put it, but okay).
    Thought:For the second question, I need to calculate the age raised to the 0.43 power. I will use the calculator tool.
    Action:
    ```
    {
      "action": "Calculator",
      "action_input": "((2022-1995)^0.43)"

    Observation: Answer: 4.125593352125936
    Thought:I now know the final answer.
    Final Answer: Gigi Hadid is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend and her current age raised to the 0.43 power is approximately 4.13.
