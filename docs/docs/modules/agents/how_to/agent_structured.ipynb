    "- If no function is called, assume that we should use the response to respond to the user, and therefore return `AgentFinish`\n",
    "- If the `Response` function is called, respond to the user with the inputs to that function (our structured output), and therefore return `AgentFinish`\n",
    "- If any other function is called, treat that as a tool invocation, and therefore return `AgentActionMessageLog`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we are using `AgentActionMessageLog` rather than `AgentAction` because it lets us attach a log of messages that we can use in the future to pass back into the agent prompt."
