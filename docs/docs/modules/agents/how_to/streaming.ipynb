    "# Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming is an important UX consideration for LLM apps, and agents are no exception. Streaming with agents is made more complicated by the fact that it's not just tokens of the final answer that you will want to stream, but you may also want to stream back the intermediate steps an agent takes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll cover the `stream/astream` and `astream_events` for streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our agent will use a tools API for tool invocation with the tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `where_cat_is_hiding`:  Returns a location where the cat is hiding\n",
    "2. `get_items`: Lists items that can be found in a particular place\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools will allow us to explore streaming in a more interesting situation where the agent will have to use both tools to answer some questions (e.g., to answer the question `what items are located where the cat is hiding?`).\n",

    "#### Using callbacks (Legacy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach to streaming is using callbacks. This may be useful if you're still on an older version of LangChain and cannot upgrade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generall, this is **NOT** a recommended approach because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. for most applications, you'll need to create two workers, write the callbacks to a queue and have another worker reading from the queue (i.e., there's hidden complexity to make this work).\n",
    "2. **end** events may be missing some metadata (e.g., like run name). So if you need the additional metadata, you should inherit from `BaseTracer` instead of `AsyncCallbackHandler` to pick up the relevant information from the runs (aka traces), or else implement the aggregation logic yourself based on the `run_id`.\n",
    "3. There is inconsistent behavior with the callbacks (e.g., how inputs and outputs are encoded) depending on the callback type that you'll need to workaround.\n",
    "\n",
    "For illustration purposes, we implement a callback below that shows how to get *token by token* streaming. Feel free to implement other callbacks based on your application needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "But `astream_events` does all of this you under the hood, so you don't have to!"
