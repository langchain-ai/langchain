    "Newer OpenAI models have been fine-tuned to detect when **one or more** function(s) should be called and respond with the inputs that should be passed to the function(s). In an API call, you can describe functions and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call these functions. The goal of the OpenAI tools APIs is to more reliably return valid and useful function calls than what can be done using a generic text completion or chat API.\n",
