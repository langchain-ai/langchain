llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history")
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools, llm, memory=memory, agent="conversational-react-description", verbose=True
)
output = agent.run(
    input=(
        "What is in this image https://storage.googleapis.com/causal-diffusion.appspot.com/imagePrompts%2F0rw369i5h9t%2Foriginal.png. "

    Observation: In a charmingly whimsical scene, a young girl is seen braving the rain alongside her furry companion, the lovable Totoro. The two are depicted standing on a bustling street corner, where they are sheltered from the rain by a bright yellow umbrella. The girl, dressed in a cheerful yellow frock, holds onto the umbrella with both hands while gazing up at Totoro with an expression of wonder and delight.
    
    Totoro, meanwhile, stands tall and proud beside his young friend, holding his own umbrella aloft to protect them both from the downpour. His furry body is rendered in rich shades of grey and white, while his large ears and wide eyes lend him an endearing charm.
    
    In the background of the scene, a street sign can be seen jutting out from the pavement amidst a flurry of raindrops. A sign with Chinese characters adorns its surface, adding to the sense of cultural diversity and intrigue. Despite the dreary weather, there is an undeniable sense of joy and camaraderie in this heartwarming image.
