# SearxNG Search API

This notebook goes over how to use a self hosted SearxNG search API to search the web.

You can [check this link](https://docs.searxng.org/dev/search_api.html) for more informations about Searx API parameters.

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->


```python
import pprint
from langchain.utilities import SearxSearchWrapper
```


```python
search = SearxSearchWrapper(searx_host="http://127.0.0.1:8888")
```

For some engines, if a direct `answer` is available the warpper will print the answer instead of the full list of search results. You can use the `results` method of the wrapper if you want to obtain all the results.


```python
search.run("What is the capital of France")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    'Paris is the capital of France, the largest country of Europe with 550 000 km2 (65 millions inhabitants). Paris has 2.234 million inhabitants end 2011. She is the core of Ile de France region (12 million people).'
```

## Custom Parameters

SearxNG supports up to [139 search engines](https://docs.searxng.org/admin/engines/configured_engines.html#configured-engines). You can also customize the Searx wrapper with arbitrary named parameters that will be passed to the Searx search API . In the below example we will making a more interesting use of custom search parameters from searx search api.

In this example we will be using the `engines` parameters to query wikipedia


```python
search = SearxSearchWrapper(searx_host="http://127.0.0.1:8888", k=5) # k is for max number of items
```


```python
search.run("large language model ", engines=['wiki'])
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    'Large language models (LLMs) represent a major advancement in AI, with the promise of transforming domains through learned knowledge. LLM sizes have been increasing 10X every year for the last few years, and as these models grow in complexity and size, so do their capabilities.\n\nGPT-3 can translate language, write essays, generate computer code, and more — all with limited to no supervision. In July 2020, OpenAI unveiled GPT-3, a language model that was easily the largest known at the time. Put simply, GPT-3 is trained to predict the next word in a sentence, much like how a text message autocomplete feature works.\n\nA large language model, or LLM, is a deep learning algorithm that can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate text and other content based on knowledge gained from massive datasets. Large language models are among the most successful applications of transformer models.\n\nAll of today’s well-known language models—e.g., GPT-3 from OpenAI, PaLM or LaMDA from Google, Galactica or OPT from Meta, Megatron-Turing from Nvidia/Microsoft, Jurassic-1 from AI21 Labs—are...\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3are increasingly being used to generate text. These tools should be used with care, since they can generate content that is biased, non-verifiable, constitutes original research, or violates copyrights.'

Passing other Searx parameters for searx like `language`


```python
search = SearxSearchWrapper(searx_host="http://127.0.0.1:8888", k=1)
search.run("deep learning", language='es', engines=['wiki'])
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    'Aprendizaje profundo (en inglés, deep learning) es un conjunto de algoritmos de aprendizaje automático (en inglés, machine learning) que intenta modelar abstracciones de alto nivel en datos usando arquitecturas computacionales que admiten transformaciones no lineales múltiples e iterativas de datos expresados en forma matricial o tensorial. 1'
```

## Obtaining results with metadata

In this example we will be looking for scientific paper using the `categories` parameter and limiting the results to a `time_range` (not all engines support the time range option).

We also would like to obtain the results in a structured way including metadata. For this we will be using the `results` method of the wrapper.


```python
search = SearxSearchWrapper(searx_host="http://127.0.0.1:8888")
```


```python
results = search.results("Large Language Model prompt", num_results=5, categories='science', time_range='year')
pprint.pp(results)
```
