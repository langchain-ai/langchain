# Shell Tool

Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).

The LLM can use it to execute any shell commands. A common use case for this is letting the LLM interact with your local file system.

```python
from langchain.tools import ShellTool

shell_tool = ShellTool()
```


```python
print(shell_tool.run({"commands": ["echo 'Hello World!'", "time"]}))
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

### Use with Agents

As with all tools, these can be given to an agent to accomplish more complex tasks. Let's have the agent fetch some links from a web page.


```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)

shell_tool.description = shell_tool.description + f"args {shell_tool.args}".replace("{", "{{").replace("}", "}}")
self_ask_with_search = initialize_agent([shell_tool], llm, agent=AgentType.CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)
self_ask_with_search.run("Download the langchain.com webpage and grep for all urls. Return only a sorted list of them. Be sure to use double quotes.")
```

    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    Question: What is the task?
    Thought: We need to download the langchain.com webpage and extract all the URLs from it. Then we need to sort the URLs and return them.
    Action:
    ```
    {
      "action": "shell",
      "action_input": {
        "commands": [
          "curl -s https://langchain.com | grep -o 'http[s]*://[^\" ]*' | sort"
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    Thought:The URLs have been successfully extracted and sorted. We can return the list of URLs as the final answer.
