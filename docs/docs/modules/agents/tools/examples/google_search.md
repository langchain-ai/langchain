# Google Search

This notebook goes over how to use the google search component.

First, you need to set up the proper API keys and environment variables. To set it up, create the GOOGLE_API_KEY in the Google Cloud credential console (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and a GOOGLE_CSE_ID using the Programmable Search Enginge (https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/create). Next, it is good to follow the instructions found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37083058/programmatically-searching-google-in-python-using-custom-search).

Then we will need to set some environment variables.

## Number of Results
You can use the `k` parameter to set the number of results


```python
search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper(k=1)

tool = Tool(
    name = "I'm Feeling Lucky",
    description="Search Google and return the first result.",
    func=search.run
)
```


```python
tool.run("python")
```

## Metadata Results

Run query through GoogleSearch and return snippet, title, and link metadata.

- Snippet: The description of the result.
- Title: The title of the result.
- Link: The link to the result.


```python
search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()

def top5_results(query):
    return search.results(query, 5)

tool = Tool(
    name = "Google Search Snippets",
    description="Search Google for recent results.",
    func=top5_results
)
```
