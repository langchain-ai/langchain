# Gradio Tools

There are many 1000s of Gradio apps on Hugging Face Spaces. This library puts them at the tips of your LLM's fingers 🦾

Specifically, gradio-tools is a Python library for converting Gradio apps into tools that can be leveraged by a large language model (LLM)-based agent to complete its task. For example, an LLM could use a Gradio tool to transcribe a voice recording it finds online and then summarize it for you. Or it could use a different Gradio tool to apply OCR to a document on your Google Drive and then answer questions about it.

It's very easy to create you own tool if you want to use a space that's not one of the pre-built tools. Please see this section of the gradio-tools documentation for information on how to do that. All contributions are welcome!

```

## Using a tool


```python
from gradio_tools.tools import StableDiffusionTool
```


```python
local_file_path = StableDiffusionTool().langchain.run("Please create a photo of a dog riding a skateboard")
local_file_path
```

## Using within an agent


```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from gradio_tools.tools import (StableDiffusionTool, ImageCaptioningTool, StableDiffusionPromptGeneratorTool,
                                TextToVideoTool)

from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history")
tools = [StableDiffusionTool().langchain, ImageCaptioningTool().langchain,
         StableDiffusionPromptGeneratorTool().langchain, TextToVideoTool().langchain]


agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, memory=memory, agent="conversational-react-description", verbose=True)
output = agent.run(input=("Please create a photo of a dog riding a skateboard "
                          "but improve my prompt prior to using an image generator."
                          "Please caption the generated image and create a video for it using the improved prompt."))
```
