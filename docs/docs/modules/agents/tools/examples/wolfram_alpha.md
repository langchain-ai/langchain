# Wolfram Alpha

This notebook goes over how to use the wolfram alpha component.

First, you need to set up your Wolfram Alpha developer account and get your APP ID:

1. Go to wolfram alpha and sign up for a developer account [here](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/)
2. Create an app and get your APP ID
3. pip install wolframalpha

Then we will need to set some environment variables:
1. Save your APP ID into WOLFRAM_ALPHA_APPID env variable
