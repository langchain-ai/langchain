```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)
math_llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.0)
tools = load_tools(
    ["human", "llm-math"], 
    llm=math_llm,
)

agent_chain = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
)
```

In the above code you can see the tool takes input directly from command line.
You can customize `prompt_func` and `input_func` according to your need (as shown below).


```python
agent_chain.run("What's my friend Eric's surname?")
# Answer with 'Zhu'
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    I don't know Eric's surname, so I should ask a human for guidance.
    Action: Human
    Action Input: "What is Eric's surname?"
    
    What is Eric's surname?
     Zhu
    
    Observation: Zhu
    Thought:I now know Eric's surname is Zhu.
    Final Answer: Eric's surname is Zhu.
    
    > Finished chain.





    "Eric's surname is Zhu."
```

## Configuring the Input Function

By default, the `HumanInputRun` tool uses the python `input` function to get input from the user.
You can customize the input_func to be anything you'd like.
For instance, if you want to accept multi-line input, you could do the following:


```python
def get_input() -> str:
    print("Insert your text. Enter 'q' or press Ctrl-D (or Ctrl-Z on Windows) to end.")
    contents = []
    while True:
        try:
            line = input()
        except EOFError:
            break
        if line == "q":
            break
        contents.append(line)
    return "\n".join(contents)


# You can modify the tool when loading
tools = load_tools(
    ["human", "ddg-search"], 
    llm=math_llm,
    input_func=get_input
)
```


```python
# Or you can directly instantiate the tool
from langchain.tools import HumanInputRun

tool = HumanInputRun(input_func=get_input)
```


```python
agent_chain = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
)
```


```python
agent_chain.run("I need help attributing a quote")
