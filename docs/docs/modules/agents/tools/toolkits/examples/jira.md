This notebook goes over how to use the Jira tool.
The Jira tool allows agents to interact with a given Jira instance, performing actions such as searching for issues and creating issues, the tool wraps the atlassian-python-api library, for more see: https://atlassian-python-api.readthedocs.io/jira.html

To use this tool, you must first set as environment variables:
    JIRA_API_TOKEN
