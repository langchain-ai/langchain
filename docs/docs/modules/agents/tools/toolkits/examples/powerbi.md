# PowerBI Dataset Agent

This notebook showcases an agent designed to interact with a Power BI Dataset. The agent is designed to answer more general questions about a dataset, as well as recover from errors.

Note that, as this agent is in active development, all answers might not be correct. It runs against the [executequery endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/datasets/execute-queries), which does not allow deletes.

### Some notes
- It relies on authentication with the azure.identity package, which can be installed with `pip install azure-identity`. Alternatively you can create the powerbi dataset with a token as a string without supplying the credentials.
- You can also supply a username to impersonate for use with datasets that have RLS enabled. 
- The toolkit uses a LLM to create the query from the question, the agent uses the LLM for the overall execution.
- Testing was done mostly with a `text-davinci-003` model, codex models did not seem to perform ver well.

## Initialization


```python
from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_pbi_agent
from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import PowerBIToolkit
from langchain.utilities.powerbi import PowerBIDataset
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
```


```python
fast_llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.5, max_tokens=1000, model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", verbose=True)
smart_llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, max_tokens=100, model_name="gpt-4", verbose=True)

toolkit = PowerBIToolkit(
    powerbi=PowerBIDataset(dataset_id="<dataset_id>", table_names=['table1', 'table2'], credential=DefaultAzureCredential()), 
    llm=smart_llm
)

agent_executor = create_pbi_agent(
    llm=fast_llm,
    toolkit=toolkit,
    verbose=True,
)
```

## Example: describing a table


```python
agent_executor.run("Describe table1")
```

## Example: simple query on a table
In this example, the agent actually figures out the correct query to get a row count of the table.


```python
agent_executor.run("How many records are in table1?")
```

## Example: running queries


```python
agent_executor.run("How many records are there by dimension1 in table2?")
```


```python
agent_executor.run("What unique values are there for dimensions2 in table2")
```

## Example: add your own few-shot prompts


```python
#fictional example
few_shots = """
Question: How many rows are in the table revenue?
DAX: EVALUATE ROW("Number of rows", COUNTROWS(revenue_details))
----
Question: How many rows are in the table revenue where year is not empty?
DAX: EVALUATE ROW("Number of rows", COUNTROWS(FILTER(revenue_details, revenue_details[year] <> "")))
----
Question: What was the average of value in revenue in dollars?
DAX: EVALUATE ROW("Average", AVERAGE(revenue_details[dollar_value]))
----
"""

)
agent_executor = create_pbi_agent(
    llm=fast_llm,

)
```


```python
agent_executor.run("What was the maximum of value in revenue in dollars in 2022?")
```
