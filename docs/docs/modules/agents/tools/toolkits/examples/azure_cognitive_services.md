# Azure Cognitive Services Toolkit

This toolkit is used to interact with the Azure Cognitive Services API to achieve some multimodal capabilities.

Currently There are four tools bundled in this toolkit:
- AzureCogsImageAnalysisTool: used to extract caption, objects, tags, and text from images. (Note: this tool is not available on Mac OS yet, due to the dependency on `azure-ai-vision` package, which is only supported on Windows and Linux currently.)
- AzureCogsFormRecognizerTool: used to extract text, tables, and key-value pairs from documents.
- AzureCogsSpeech2TextTool: used to transcribe speech to text.
- AzureCogsText2SpeechTool: used to synthesize text to speech.

First, you need to set up an Azure account and create a Cognitive Services resource. You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account?tabs=multiservice%2Cwindows) to create a resource. 

Then, you need to get the endpoint, key and region of your resource, and set them as environment variables. You can find them in the "Keys and Endpoint" page of your resource.


```python
# !pip install --upgrade azure-ai-formrecognizer > /dev/null
# !pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-speech > /dev/null

# For Windows/Linux
# !pip install --upgrade azure-ai-vision > /dev/null
```


```python
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-"
os.environ["AZURE_COGS_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["AZURE_COGS_ENDPOINT"] = ""
os.environ["AZURE_COGS_REGION"] = ""
```

## Create the Toolkit


```python
from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import AzureCognitiveServicesToolkit

toolkit = AzureCognitiveServicesToolkit()
```


```python
[tool.name for tool in toolkit.get_tools()]
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    ['Azure Cognitive Services Image Analysis',
     'Azure Cognitive Services Form Recognizer',
     'Azure Cognitive Services Speech2Text',
     'Azure Cognitive Services Text2Speech']
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## Use within an Agent


```python
from langchain import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, AgentType
```


```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=toolkit.get_tools(),
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
)
```


```python
agent.run("What can I make with these ingredients?"
          "https://images.openai.com/blob/9ad5a2ab-041f-475f-ad6a-b51899c50182/ingredients.png")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```

      "action_input": "https://images.openai.com/blob/9ad5a2ab-041f-475f-ad6a-b51899c50182/ingredients.png"
    }
    ```
    
    
    Observation: Caption: a group of eggs and flour in bowls
    Objects: Egg, Egg, Food
    Tags: dairy, ingredient, indoor, thickening agent, food, mixing bowl, powder, flour, egg, bowl
    Thought: I can use the objects and tags to suggest recipes
    Action:
    ```
    {
      "action": "Final Answer",
      "action_input": "You can make pancakes, omelettes, or quiches with these ingredients!"
    }
    ```
    
    > Finished chain.





    'You can make pancakes, omelettes, or quiches with these ingredients!'
```

```python
audio_file = agent.run("Tell me a joke and read it out for me.")
```

    }
    ```
    
    
    Observation: /tmp/tmpa3uu_j6b.wav
