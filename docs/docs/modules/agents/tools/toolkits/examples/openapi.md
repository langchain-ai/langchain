# OpenAPI agents

We can construct agents to consume arbitrary APIs, here APIs conformant to the OpenAPI/Swagger specification.

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->

## 1st example: hierarchical planning agent

In this example, we'll consider an approach called hierarchical planning, common in robotics and appearing in recent works for LLMs X robotics. We'll see it's a viable approach to start working with a massive API spec AND to assist with user queries that require multiple steps against the API.

The idea is simple: to get coherent agent behavior over long sequences behavior & to save on tokens, we'll separate concerns: a "planner" will be responsible for what endpoints to call and a "controller" will be responsible for how to call them.

In the initial implementation, the planner is an LLM chain that has the name and a short description for each endpoint in context. The controller is an LLM agent that is instantiated with documentation for only the endpoints for a particular plan. There's a lot left to get this working very robustly :)

### To start, let's collect some OpenAPI specs.

We'll work with the Spotify API as one of the examples of a somewhat complex API. There's a bit of auth-related setup to do if you want to replicate this.

- You'll have to set up an application in the Spotify developer console, documented [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/), to get credentials: `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `REDIRECT_URI`.
- To get an access tokens (and keep them fresh), you can implement the oauth flows, or you can use `spotipy`. If you've set your Spotify creedentials as environment variables `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI`, you can use the helper functions below:


```python
import spotipy.util as util
from langchain.requests import RequestsWrapper

def construct_spotify_auth_headers(raw_spec: dict):
    scopes = list(raw_spec['components']['securitySchemes']['oauth_2_0']['flows']['authorizationCode']['scopes'].keys())
    access_token = util.prompt_for_user_token(scope=','.join(scopes))
    return {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'
    }

# Get API credentials.
headers = construct_spotify_auth_headers(raw_spotify_api_spec)
requests_wrapper = RequestsWrapper(headers=headers)
```

### How big is this spec?


```python
endpoints = [
    (route, operation)
    for route, operations in raw_spotify_api_spec["paths"].items()
    for operation in operations
    if operation in ["get", "post"]
]
len(endpoints)
```

Takes awhile to get there!

## 2nd example: "json explorer" agent

Here's an agent that's not particularly practical, but neat! The agent has access to 2 toolkits. One comprises tools to interact with json: one tool to list the keys of a json object and another tool to get the value for a given key. The other toolkit comprises `requests` wrappers to send GET and POST requests. This agent consumes a lot calls to the language model, but does a surprisingly decent job.



```python
from langchain.agents import create_openapi_agent
from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import OpenAPIToolkit
from langchain.llms.openai import OpenAI
from langchain.requests import TextRequestsWrapper
from langchain.tools.json.tool import JsonSpec
```


```python
with open("openai_openapi.yaml") as f:
    data = yaml.load(f, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)
json_spec=JsonSpec(dict_=data, max_value_length=4000)


openapi_toolkit = OpenAPIToolkit.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), json_spec, openai_requests_wrapper, verbose=True)
openapi_agent_executor = create_openapi_agent(
    llm=OpenAI(temperature=0),
    toolkit=openapi_toolkit,
    verbose=True
)
```


```python
openapi_agent_executor.run("Make a post request to openai /completions. The prompt should be 'tell me a joke.'")
