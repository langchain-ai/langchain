# Pandas Dataframe Agent

This notebook shows how to use agents to interact with a pandas dataframe. It is mostly optimized for question answering.

**NOTE: this agent calls the Python agent under the hood, which executes LLM generated Python code - this can be bad if the LLM generated Python code is harmful. Use cautiously.**

```python
from langchain.agents import create_pandas_dataframe_agent
```


```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('titanic.csv')
```


```python
agent = create_pandas_dataframe_agent(OpenAI(temperature=0), df, verbose=True)
```


```python
agent.run("how many rows are there?")
```

    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    Thought: I need to count the number of rows
    Action: python_repl_ast
    Action Input: df.shape[0]
    Observation: 891
    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: There are 891 rows.
    
    > Finished chain.





    'There are 891 rows.'
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
agent.run("how many people have more than 3 siblings")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    Thought: I need to count the number of people with more than 3 siblings
    Action: python_repl_ast
    Action Input: df[df['SibSp'] > 3].shape[0]
    Observation: 30
    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: 30 people have more than 3 siblings.
    
    > Finished chain.





    '30 people have more than 3 siblings.'
```

```python
agent.run("whats the square root of the average age?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    Thought: I need to calculate the average age first
    Action: python_repl_ast
    Action Input: df['Age'].mean()
    Observation: 29.69911764705882
    Thought: I now need to calculate the square root of the average age
    Action: python_repl_ast
    Action Input: math.sqrt(df['Age'].mean())
    Observation: NameError("name 'math' is not defined")
    Thought: I need to import the math library
    Action: python_repl_ast
    Action Input: import math
    Observation: 
    Thought: I now need to calculate the square root of the average age
    Action: python_repl_ast
    Action Input: math.sqrt(df['Age'].mean())
    Observation: 5.449689683556195
    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: The square root of the average age is 5.449689683556195.
    
    > Finished chain.





    'The square root of the average age is 5.449689683556195.'
```

### Multi DataFrame Example

This next part shows how the agent can interact with multiple dataframes passed in as a list.


```python
df1 = df.copy()
df1["Age"] = df1["Age"].fillna(df1["Age"].mean())
```


```python
agent = create_pandas_dataframe_agent(OpenAI(temperature=0), [df, df1], verbose=True)
agent.run("how many rows in the age column are different?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    Thought: I need to compare the age columns in both dataframes
    Action: python_repl_ast
    Action Input: len(df1[df1['Age'] != df2['Age']])
    Observation: 177
    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: 177 rows in the age column are different.
    
    > Finished chain.





    '177 rows in the age column are different.'
```
