# SQL Database Agent

This notebook showcases an agent designed to interact with a sql databases. The agent builds off of [SQLDatabaseChain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/chains/examples/sqlite.html) and is designed to answer more general questions about a database, as well as recover from errors.

Note that, as this agent is in active development, all answers might not be correct. Additionally, it is not guaranteed that the agent won't perform DML statements on your database given certain questions. Be careful running it on sensitive data!

This uses the example Chinook database. To set it up follow the instructions on https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/, placing the .db file in a notebooks folder at the root of this repository.

## Initialization


```python
from langchain.agents import create_sql_agent
from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import SQLDatabaseToolkit
from langchain.sql_database import SQLDatabase
from langchain.llms.openai import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor
```


```python
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///../../../../notebooks/Chinook.db")
toolkit = SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db)

agent_executor = create_sql_agent(
    llm=OpenAI(temperature=0),
    toolkit=toolkit,
    verbose=True
)
```

## Example: describing a table


```python
agent_executor.run("Describe the playlisttrack table")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    Action: list_tables_sql_db
    Action Input: ""
    Observation: Artist, Invoice, Playlist, Genre, Album, PlaylistTrack, Track, InvoiceLine, MediaType, Employee, Customer
    Thought: I should look at the schema of the playlisttrack table
    Action: schema_sql_db
    Action Input: "PlaylistTrack"
    Observation: 
    CREATE TABLE "PlaylistTrack" (

    	"TrackId" INTEGER NOT NULL, 
    	PRIMARY KEY ("PlaylistId", "TrackId"), 
    	FOREIGN KEY("TrackId") REFERENCES "Track" ("TrackId"), 
    	FOREIGN KEY("PlaylistId") REFERENCES "Playlist" ("PlaylistId")
    )
    
    SELECT * FROM 'PlaylistTrack' LIMIT 3;
    PlaylistId TrackId
    1 3402
    1 3389
    1 3390
    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: The PlaylistTrack table has two columns, PlaylistId and TrackId, and is linked to the Playlist and Track tables.

    'The PlaylistTrack table has two columns, PlaylistId and TrackId, and is linked to the Playlist and Track tables.'

## Example: describing a table, recovering from an error

In this example, the agent tries to search for a table that doesn't exist, but finds the next best result


```python
agent_executor.run("Describe the playlistsong table")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    Action: list_tables_sql_db
    Action Input: ""
    Observation: Genre, PlaylistTrack, MediaType, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, Playlist, Customer, Album, Employee, Artist
    Thought: I should look at the schema of the PlaylistSong table
    Action: schema_sql_db
    Action Input: "PlaylistSong"
    Observation: Error: table_names {'PlaylistSong'} not found in database
    Thought: I should check the spelling of the table
    Action: list_tables_sql_db
    Action Input: ""
    Observation: Genre, PlaylistTrack, MediaType, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, Playlist, Customer, Album, Employee, Artist
    Thought: The table is called PlaylistTrack
    Action: schema_sql_db
    Action Input: "PlaylistTrack"
    Observation: 
    CREATE TABLE "PlaylistTrack" (
    	"PlaylistId" INTEGER NOT NULL, 
    	"TrackId" INTEGER NOT NULL, 
    	PRIMARY KEY ("PlaylistId", "TrackId"), 
    	FOREIGN KEY("TrackId") REFERENCES "Track" ("TrackId"), 
    	FOREIGN KEY("PlaylistId") REFERENCES "Playlist" ("PlaylistId")
    )
    
    SELECT * FROM 'PlaylistTrack' LIMIT 3;
    PlaylistId TrackId
    1 3402
    1 3389
    1 3390
    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: The PlaylistTrack table contains two columns, PlaylistId and TrackId, which are both integers and are used to link Playlist and Track tables.

## Recovering from an error

In this example, the agent is able to recover from an error after initially trying to access an attribute (`Track.ArtistId`) which doesn't exist.


```python
agent_executor.run("Who are the top 3 best selling artists?")
```
