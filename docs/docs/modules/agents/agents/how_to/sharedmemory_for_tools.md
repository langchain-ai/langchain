# How to add SharedMemory to an Agent and its Tools

This notebook goes over adding memory to **both** of an Agent and its tools. Before going through this notebook, please walk through the following notebooks, as this will build on top of both of them:

- [Adding memory to an LLM Chain](../../../memory/examples/adding_memory.ipynb)
- [Custom Agents](../../agents/how_to/custom_agent.ipynb)

We are going to create a custom Agent. The agent has access to a conversation memory, search tool, and a summarization tool. And, the summarization tool also needs access to the conversation memory.

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->


```python
from langchain.agents import ZeroShotAgent, Tool, AgentExecutor
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory, ReadOnlySharedMemory
from langchain import OpenAI, LLMChain, PromptTemplate
from langchain.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper
```


```python
template = """This is a conversation between a human and a bot:

{chat_history}

Write a summary of the conversation for {input}:
"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["input", "chat_history"], 
    template=template
)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history")
readonlymemory = ReadOnlySharedMemory(memory=memory)
summry_chain = LLMChain(
    llm=OpenAI(), 
    prompt=prompt, 
    verbose=True, 
    memory=readonlymemory, # use the read-only memory to prevent the tool from modifying the memory
)
```


```python
search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name = "Search",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"
    ),
    Tool(
        name = "Summary",
        func=summry_chain.run,
        description="useful for when you summarize a conversation. The input to this tool should be a string, representing who will read this summary."
    )
]
```


```python
prefix = """Have a conversation with a human, answering the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:"""
suffix = """Begin!"

{chat_history}
Question: {input}
{agent_scratchpad}"""

prompt = ZeroShotAgent.create_prompt(
    tools, 
    prefix=prefix, 
    suffix=suffix, 
    input_variables=["input", "chat_history", "agent_scratchpad"]
)
```

We can now construct the LLMChain, with the Memory object, and then create the agent.


```python
llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), prompt=prompt)
agent = ZeroShotAgent(llm_chain=llm_chain, tools=tools, verbose=True)
agent_chain = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True, memory=memory)
```


```python
agent_chain.run(input="What is ChatGPT?")
```
