# How to access intermediate steps

In order to get more visibility into what an agent is doing, we can also return intermediate steps. This comes in the form of an extra key in the return value, which is a list of (action, observation) tuples.

```python
from langchain.agents import load_tools
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
```

Initialize the components needed for the agent.


```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, model_name='text-davinci-002')
tools = load_tools(["serpapi", "llm-math"], llm=llm)
```

Initialize the agent with `return_intermediate_steps=True`


```python
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, return_intermediate_steps=True)
```


```python
response = agent({"input":"Who is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?"})
```

     I should look up who Leo DiCaprio is dating
    Action: Search
    Action Input: "Leo DiCaprio girlfriend"
    Observation: Camila Morrone
    Thought: I should look up how old Camila Morrone is
    Action: Search
    Action Input: "Camila Morrone age"
    Observation: 25 years
    Thought: I should calculate what 25 years raised to the 0.43 power is
    Action: Calculator
    Action Input: 25^0.43
    Observation: Answer: 3.991298452658078
    
    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: Camila Morrone is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend and she is 3.991298452658078 years old.
