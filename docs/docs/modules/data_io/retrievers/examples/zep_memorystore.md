# Zep

>[Zep](https://docs.getzep.com/) - A long-term memory store for LLM applications.

More on `Zep`:

`Zep` stores, summarizes, embeds, indexes, and enriches conversational AI chat histories, and exposes them via simple, low-latency APIs.

Key Features:

- Long-term memory persistence, with access to historical messages irrespective of your summarization strategy.
- Auto-summarization of memory messages based on a configurable message window. A series of summaries are stored, providing flexibility for future summarization strategies.
- Vector search over memories, with messages automatically embedded on creation.
- Auto-token counting of memories and summaries, allowing finer-grained control over prompt assembly.
- Python and JavaScript SDKs.

Zep's Go Extractor model is easily extensible, with a simple, clean interface available to build new enrichment functionality, such as summarizers, entity extractors, embedders, and more.

## Retriever Example

This notebook demonstrates how to search historical chat message histories using the [Zep Long-term Memory Store](https://getzep.github.io/).

We'll demonstrate:

1. Adding conversation history to the Zep memory store.
2. Vector search over the conversation history.




```python
from langchain.memory.chat_message_histories import ZepChatMessageHistory
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, AIMessage
from uuid import uuid4

# Set this to your Zep server URL
ZEP_API_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
```

### Initialize the Zep Chat Message History Class and add a chat message history to the memory store

**NOTE:** Unlike other Retrievers, the content returned by the Zep Retriever is session/user specific. A `session_id` is required when instantiating the Retriever.


```python
session_id = str(uuid4())  # This is a unique identifier for the user/session

# Set up Zep Chat History. We'll use this to add chat histories to the memory store
zep_chat_history = ZepChatMessageHistory(
    session_id=session_id,
    url=ZEP_API_URL,
)
```


```python
# Preload some messages into the memory. The default message window is 12 messages. We want to push beyond this to demonstrate auto-summarization.
test_history = [
    {"role": "human", "content": "Who was Octavia Butler?"},
    {
        "role": "ai",
        "content": (
            "Octavia Estelle Butler (June 22, 1947 – February 24, 2006) was an American"
            " science fiction author."
        ),
    },
    {"role": "human", "content": "Which books of hers were made into movies?"},
    {
        "role": "ai",
        "content": (
            "The most well-known adaptation of Octavia Butler's work is the FX series"
            " Kindred, based on her novel of the same name."
        ),
    },
    {"role": "human", "content": "Who were her contemporaries?"},
    {
        "role": "ai",
        "content": (
            "Octavia Butler's contemporaries included Ursula K. Le Guin, Samuel R."
            " Delany, and Joanna Russ."
        ),
    },
    {"role": "human", "content": "What awards did she win?"},
    {
        "role": "ai",
        "content": (
            "Octavia Butler won the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award, and the MacArthur"
            " Fellowship."
        ),
    },
    {
        "role": "human",
        "content": "Which other women sci-fi writers might I want to read?",
    },
    {
        "role": "ai",
        "content": "You might want to read Ursula K. Le Guin or Joanna Russ.",
    },
    {
        "role": "human",
        "content": (
            "Write a short synopsis of Butler's book, Parable of the Sower. What is it"
            " about?"
        ),
    },
    {
        "role": "ai",
        "content": (
            "Parable of the Sower is a science fiction novel by Octavia Butler,"
            " published in 1993. It follows the story of Lauren Olamina, a young woman"
            " living in a dystopian future where society has collapsed due to"
            " environmental disasters, poverty, and violence."
        ),
    },
]

for msg in test_history:
    zep_chat_history.append(
        HumanMessage(content=msg["content"])
        if msg["role"] == "human"
        else AIMessage(content=msg["content"])
    )
```

### Use the Zep Retriever to vector search over the Zep memory

Zep provides native vector search over historical conversation memory. Embedding happens automatically.

NOTE: Embedding of messages occurs asynchronously, so the first query may not return results. Subsequent queries will return results as the embeddings are generated.


```python
from langchain.retrievers import ZepRetriever

zep_retriever = ZepRetriever(
    session_id=session_id,  # Ensure that you provide the session_id when instantiating the Retriever
    url=ZEP_API_URL,
    top_k=5,
)

await zep_retriever.aget_relevant_documents("Who wrote Parable of the Sower?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    [Document(page_content='Who was Octavia Butler?', metadata={'score': 0.7759001673780126, 'uuid': '3a82a02f-056e-4c6a-b960-67ebdf3b2b93', 'created_at': '2023-05-25T15:03:30.2041Z', 'role': 'human', 'token_count': 8}),

We can also use the Zep sync API to retrieve results:


```python
zep_retriever.get_relevant_documents("Who wrote Parable of the Sower?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">
