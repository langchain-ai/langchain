# Databerry

>[Databerry platform](https://docs.databerry.ai/introduction) brings data from anywhere (Datsources: Text, PDF, Word, PowerPpoint, Excel, Notion, Airtable, Google Sheets, etc..) into Datastores (container of multiple Datasources).
Then your Datastores can be connected to ChatGPT via Plugins or any other Large Langue Model (LLM) via the `Databerry API`.

This notebook shows how to use [Databerry's](https://www.databerry.ai/) retriever.

First, you will need to sign up for Databerry, create a datastore, add some data and get your datastore api endpoint url. You need the [API Key](https://docs.databerry.ai/api-reference/authentication).

## Query

Now that our index is set up, we can set up a retriever and start querying it.


```python
from langchain.retrievers import DataberryRetriever
```


```python
retriever = DataberryRetriever(
    datastore_url="https://clg1xg2h80000l708dymr0fxc.databerry.ai/query",
    # api_key="DATABERRY_API_KEY", # optional if datastore is public
    # top_k=10 # optional
)
```


```python
retriever.get_relevant_documents("What is Daftpage?")
```
