This notebook covers how to load data from the `Stripe REST API` into a format that can be ingested into LangChain, along with example usage for vectorization.

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->


```python
import os


from langchain.document_loaders import StripeLoader
from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator
```

The Stripe API requires an access token, which can be found inside of the Stripe dashboard.

This document loader also requires a `resource` option which defines what data you want to load.

Following resources are available:

`balance_transations` [Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/balance_transactions/list)

`charges` [Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/charges/list)

`customers` [Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/list)

`events` [Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/list)

`refunds` [Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/refunds/list)

`disputes` [Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/disputes/list)


```python
stripe_loader = StripeLoader("charges")
```


```python
# Create a vectorstore retriver from the loader
# see https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/getting_started.html for more details

index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([stripe_loader])
stripe_doc_retriever = index.vectorstore.as_retriever()
```
