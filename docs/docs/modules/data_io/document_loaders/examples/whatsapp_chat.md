# WhatsApp Chat

>[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) (also called `WhatsApp Messenger`) is a freeware, cross-platform, centralized instant messaging (IM) and voice-over-IP (VoIP) service. It allows users to send text and voice messages, make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other content.
