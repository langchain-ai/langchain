# Subtitle

>[The SubRip file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip#SubRip_file_format) is described on the `Matroska` multimedia container format website as "perhaps the most basic of all subtitle formats." `SubRip (SubRip Text)` files are named with the extension `.srt`, and contain formatted lines of plain text in groups separated by a blank line. Subtitles are numbered sequentially, starting at 1. The timecode format used is hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds with time units fixed to two zero-padded digits and fractions fixed to three zero-padded digits (00:00:00,000). The fractional separator used is the comma, since the program was written in France.
