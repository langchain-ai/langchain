# EPub 

>[EPUB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) is an e-book file format that uses the ".epub" file extension. The term is short for electronic publication and is sometimes styled ePub. `EPUB` is supported by many e-readers, and compatible software is available for most smartphones, tablets, and computers.

This covers how to load `.epub` documents into the Document format that we can use downstream. You'll need to install the [`pandocs`](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) package for this loader to work.

```python
#!pip install pandocs
```


```python
from langchain.document_loaders import UnstructuredEPubLoader
```


```python
loader = UnstructuredEPubLoader("winter-sports.epub")
```


```python
data = loader.load()
```

## Retain Elements

Under the hood, Unstructured creates different "elements" for different chunks of text. By default we combine those together, but you can easily keep that separation by specifying `mode="elements"`.


```python
loader = UnstructuredEPubLoader("winter-sports.epub", mode="elements")
```


```python
data = loader.load()
```


```python
data[0]
```
