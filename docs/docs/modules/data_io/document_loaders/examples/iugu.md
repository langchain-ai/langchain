iugu_loader = IuguLoader("charges")
```

# Create a vectorstore retriver from the loader
# see https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/getting_started.html for more details

index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([iugu_loader])
iugu_doc_retriever = index.vectorstore.as_retriever()
```
