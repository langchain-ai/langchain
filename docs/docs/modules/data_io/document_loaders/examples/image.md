# Images

This covers how to load images such as `JPG` or `PNG` into a document format that we can use downstream.

## Using Unstructured


```python
#!pip install pdfminer
```


```python
from langchain.document_loaders.image import UnstructuredImageLoader
```


```python
loader = UnstructuredImageLoader("layout-parser-paper-fast.jpg")
```


```python
data = loader.load()
```


```python
data[0]
```

### Retain Elements

Under the hood, Unstructured creates different "elements" for different chunks of text. By default we combine those together, but you can easily keep that separation by specifying `mode="elements"`.


```python
loader = UnstructuredImageLoader("layout-parser-paper-fast.jpg", mode="elements")
```


```python
data = loader.load()
```


```python
data[0]
```
