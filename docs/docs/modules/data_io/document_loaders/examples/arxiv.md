# Arxiv

>[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) is an open-access archive for 2 million scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics.

This notebook shows how to load scientific articles from `Arxiv.org` into a document format that we can use downstream.

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->

## Installation

First, you need to install `arxiv` python package.


```python
#!pip install arxiv
```

Second, you need to install `PyMuPDF` python package which transforms PDF files downloaded from the `arxiv.org` site into the text format.


```python
#!pip install pymupdf
```

## Examples

`ArxivLoader` has these arguments:
- `query`: free text which used to find documents in the Arxiv
- optional `load_max_docs`: default=100. Use it to limit number of downloaded documents. It takes time to download all 100 documents, so use a small number for experiments.
- optional `load_all_available_meta`: default=False. By default only the most important fields downloaded: `Published` (date when document was published/last updated), `Title`, `Authors`, `Summary`. If True, other fields also downloaded.


```python
from langchain.document_loaders import ArxivLoader
```


```python
docs = ArxivLoader(query="1605.08386", load_max_docs=2).load()
len(docs)
```


```python
docs[0].metadata  # meta-information of the Document
```

We\nalso state explicit conditions on the set of moves so that the heat-bath random\nwalk, a generalization of the Glauber dynamics, is an expander in fixed\ndimension.'}
