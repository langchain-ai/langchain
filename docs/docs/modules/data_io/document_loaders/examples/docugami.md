# Docugami
This notebook covers how to load documents from `Docugami`. It provides the advantages of using this system over alternative data loaders.

## Prerequisites
1. Install necessary python packages.
2. Grab an access token for your workspace, and make sure it is set as the `DOCUGAMI_API_KEY` environment variable.
3. Grab some docset and document IDs for your processed documents, as described here: https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->


```bash
# You need the lxml package to use the DocugamiLoader
pip install lxml
```

## Quick start

1. Create a [Docugami workspace](http://www.docugami.com) (free trials available)
2. Add your documents (PDF, DOCX or DOC) and allow Docugami to ingest and cluster them into sets of similar documents, e.g. NDAs, Lease Agreements, and Service Agreements. There is no fixed set of document types supported by the system, the clusters created depend on your particular documents, and you can [change the docset assignments](https://help.docugami.com/home/working-with-the-doc-sets-view) later.
3. Create an access token via the Developer Playground for your workspace. [Detailed instructions](https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api)
4. Explore the [Docugami API](https://api-docs.docugami.com) to get a list of your processed docset IDs, or just the document IDs for a particular docset. 
6. Use the DocugamiLoader as detailed below, to get rich semantic chunks for your documents.
7. Optionally, build and publish one or more [reports or abstracts](https://help.docugami.com/home/reports). This helps Docugami improve the semantic XML with better tags based on your preferences, which are then added to the DocugamiLoader output as metadata. Use techniques like [self-querying retriever](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/retrievers/examples/self_query_retriever.html) to do high accuracy Document QA.

## Advantages vs Other Chunking Techniques

Appropriate chunking of your documents is critical for retrieval from documents. Many chunking techniques exist, including simple ones that rely on whitespace and recursive chunk splitting based on character length. Docugami offers a different approach:

1. **Intelligent Chunking:** Docugami breaks down every document into a hierarchical semantic XML tree of chunks of varying sizes, from single words or numerical values to entire sections. These chunks follow the semantic contours of the document, providing a more meaningful representation than arbitrary length or simple whitespace-based chunking.
2. **Structured Representation:** In addition, the XML tree indicates the structural contours of every document, using attributes denoting headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other common elements, and does that consistently across all supported document formats, such as scanned PDFs or DOCX files. It appropriately handles long-form document characteristics like page headers/footers or multi-column flows for clean text extraction.
3. **Semantic Annotations:** Chunks are annotated with semantic tags that are coherent across the document set, facilitating consistent hierarchical queries across multiple documents, even if they are written and formatted differently. For example, in set of lease agreements, you can easily identify key provisions like the Landlord, Tenant, or Renewal Date, as well as more complex information such as the wording of any sub-lease provision or whether a specific jurisdiction has an exception section within a Termination Clause.
4. **Additional Metadata:** Chunks are also annotated with additional metadata, if a user has been using Docugami. This additional metadata can be used for high-accuracy Document QA without context window restrictions. See detailed code walk-through below.



```python
import os
from langchain.document_loaders import DocugamiLoader
```

## Load Documents

If the DOCUGAMI_API_KEY environment variable is set, there is no need to pass it in to the loader explicitly otherwise you can pass it in as the `access_token` parameter.


```python
DOCUGAMI_API_KEY=os.environ.get('DOCUGAMI_API_KEY')

# To load all docs in the given docset ID, just don't provide document_ids
loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id="ecxqpipcoe2p", document_ids=["43rj0ds7s0ur"])
docs = loader.load()
docs
```

The `metadata` for each `Document` (really, a chunk of an actual PDF, DOC or DOCX) contains some useful additional information:

1. **id and name:** ID and Name of the file (PDF, DOC or DOCX) the chunk is sourced from within Docugami.
2. **xpath:** XPath inside the XML representation of the document, for the chunk. Useful for source citations directly to the actual chunk inside the document XML.
3. **structure:** Structural attributes of the chunk, e.g. h1, h2, div, table, td, etc. Useful to filter out certain kinds of chunks if needed by the caller.
4. **tag:** Semantic tag for the chunk, using various generative and extractive techniques. More details here: https://github.com/docugami/DFM-benchmarks

## Basic Use: Docugami Loader for Document QA

You can use the Docugami Loader like a standard loader for Document QA over multiple docs, albeit with much better chunks that follow the natural contours of the document. There are many great tutorials on how to do this, e.g. [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yPBVii7Ct0). We can just use the same code, but use the `DocugamiLoader` for better chunking, instead of loading text or PDF files directly with basic splitting techniques.


```bash
poetry run pip -q install openai tiktoken chromadb
```


```python
from langchain.schema import Document
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

# For this example, we already have a processed docset for a set of lease documents
loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id="wh2kned25uqm")
documents = loader.load()
```

The documents returned by the loader are already split, so we don't need to use a text splitter. Optionally, we can use the metadata on each document, for example the structure or tag attributes, to do any post-processing we want.

We will just use the output of the `DocugamiLoader` as-is to set up a retrieval QA chain the usual way.


```python
embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=documents, embedding=embedding)
retriever = vectordb.as_retriever()
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(), chain_type="stuff", retriever=retriever, return_source_documents=True
)
```

## Using Docugami to Add Metadata to Chunks for High Accuracy Document QA

One issue with large documents is that the correct answer to your question may depend on chunks that are far apart in the document. Typical chunking techniques, even with overlap, will struggle with providing the LLM sufficent context to answer such questions. With upcoming very large context LLMs, it may be possible to stuff a lot of tokens, perhaps even entire documents, inside the context but this will still hit limits at some point with very long documents, or a lot of documents.

For example, if we ask a more complex question that requires the LLM to draw on chunks from different parts of the document, even OpenAI's powerful LLM is unable to answer correctly.


```python
chain_response = qa_chain("What is rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group?")
chain_response["result"]  # the correct answer should be 13,500
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    ' 9,753 square feet'
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

At first glance the answer may seem reasonable, but if you review the source chunks carefully for this answer, you will see that the chunking of the document did not end up putting the Landlord name and the rentable area in the same context, since they are far apart in the document. The retriever therefore ends up finding unrelated chunks from other documents not even related to the **Menlo Group** landlord. That landlord happens to be mentioned on the first page of the file **Shorebucks LLC_NJ.pdf** file, and while one of the source chunks used by the chain is indeed from that doc that contains the correct answer (**13,500**), other source chunks from different docs are included, and the answer is therefore incorrect.


```python
chain_response["source_documents"]
```

Docugami can help here. Chunks are annotated with additional metadata created using different techniques if a user has been [using Docugami](https://help.docugami.com/home/reports). More technical approaches will be added later.

Specifically, let's look at the additional metadata that is returned on the documents returned by docugami, in the form of some simple key/value pairs on all the text chunks:


```python
loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id="wh2kned25uqm")
documents = loader.load()
documents[0].metadata
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'xpath': '/docset:OFFICELEASEAGREEMENT-section/docset:OFFICELEASEAGREEMENT/docset:ThisOfficeLeaseAgreement',
     'id': 'v1bvgaozfkak',
     'name': 'TruTone Lane 2.docx',
     'structure': 'p',
     'tag': 'ThisOfficeLeaseAgreement',
     'Landlord': 'BUBBA CENTER PARTNERSHIP',
     'Tenant': 'Truetone Lane LLC'}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

We can use a [self-querying retriever](../../retrievers/examples/self_query.ipynb) to improve our query accuracy, using this additional metadata:


```python
from langchain.chains.query_constructor.schema import AttributeInfo
from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever

EXCLUDE_KEYS = ["id", "xpath", "structure"]
metadata_field_info = [
    AttributeInfo(
        name=key,
        description=f"The {key} for this chunk",
        type="string",
    )
    for key in documents[0].metadata
    if key.lower() not in EXCLUDE_KEYS
]


document_content_description = "Contents of this chunk"
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=documents, embedding=embedding)
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm, vectordb, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True
)
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(), chain_type="stuff", retriever=retriever, return_source_documents=True
)
```

Let's run the same question again. It returns the correct result since all the chunks have metadata key/value pairs on them carrying key information about the document even if this information is physically very far away from the source chunk used to generate the answer.


```python
qa_chain("What is rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    query='rentable area' filter=Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='Landlord', value='DHA Group')





    {'query': 'What is rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group?',
     'result': ' 13,500 square feet.',
     'source_documents': [Document(page_content='1.1 Landlord .

This time the answer is correct, since the self-querying retriever created a filter on the landlord attribute of the metadata, correctly filtering to document that specifically is about the DHA Group landlord. The resulting source chunks are all relevant to this landlord, and this improves answer accuracy even though the landlord is not directly mentioned in the specific chunk that contains the correct answer.
