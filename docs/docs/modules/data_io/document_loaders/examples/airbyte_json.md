>[Airbyte](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte) is a data integration platform for ELT pipelines from APIs, databases & files to warehouses & lakes. It has the largest catalog of ELT connectors to data warehouses and databases.

This covers how to load any source from Airbyte into a local JSON file that can be read in as a document

Prereqs:
Have docker desktop installed

Steps:

1) Clone Airbyte from GitHub - `git clone https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte.git`

2) Switch into Airbyte directory - `cd airbyte`

3) Start Airbyte - `docker compose up`

4) In your browser, just visit http://localhost:8000. You will be asked for a username and password. By default, that's username `airbyte` and password `password`.

5) Setup any source you wish.

6) Set destination as Local JSON, with specified destination path - lets say `/json_data`. Set up manual sync.

7) Run the connection.

7) To see what files are create, you can navigate to: `file:///tmp/airbyte_local`

8) Find your data and copy path. That path should be saved in the file variable below. It should start with `/tmp/airbyte_local`



```python
from langchain.document_loaders import AirbyteJSONLoader
```


```bash
ls /tmp/airbyte_local/json_data/
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="bash">

```
    _airbyte_raw_pokemon.jsonl
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
loader = AirbyteJSONLoader('/tmp/airbyte_local/json_data/_airbyte_raw_pokemon.jsonl')
```


```python
data = loader.load()
```


```python
print(data[0].page_content[:500])
```
