`TelegramChatApiLoader` loads data directly from any specified chat from Telegram. In order to export the data, you will need to authenticate your Telegram account. 

You can get the API_HASH and API_ID from https://my.telegram.org/auth?to=apps

chat_entity – recommended to be the [entity](https://docs.telethon.dev/en/stable/concepts/entities.html?highlight=Entity#what-is-an-entity) of a channel.




```python
loader = TelegramChatApiLoader(
    chat_entity="<CHAT_URL>", # recommended to use Entity here
    api_hash="<API HASH >", 
    api_id="<API_ID>", 
    user_name ="", # needed only for caching the session.
)
```


```python
loader.load()
```
