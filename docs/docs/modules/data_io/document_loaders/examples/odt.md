# Open Document Format (ODT)

>The [Open Document Format for Office Applications (ODF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument), also known as `OpenDocument`, is an open file format for word processing documents, spreadsheets, presentations and graphics and using ZIP-compressed XML files. It was developed with the aim of providing an open, XML-based file format specification for office applications.

>The standard is developed and maintained by a technical committee in the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (`OASIS`) consortium. It was based on the Sun Microsystems specification for OpenOffice.org XML, the default format for `OpenOffice.org` and `LibreOffice`. It was originally developed for `StarOffice` "to provide an open standard for office documents."

The `UnstructuredODTLoader` is used to load `Open Office ODT` files.
