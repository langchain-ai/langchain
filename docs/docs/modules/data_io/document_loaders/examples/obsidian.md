# Obsidian

>[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a powerful and extensible knowledge base
that works on top of your local folder of plain text files.

This notebook covers how to load documents from an `Obsidian` database.

Since `Obsidian` is just stored on disk as a folder of Markdown files, the loader just takes a path to this directory.

`Obsidian` files also sometimes contain [metadata](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Metadata) which is a YAML block at the top of the file. These values will be added to the document's metadata. (`ObsidianLoader` can also be passed a `collect_metadata=False` argument to disable this behavior.)

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import ObsidianLoader
```


```python
loader = ObsidianLoader("<path-to-obsidian>")
```


```python
docs = loader.load()
```
