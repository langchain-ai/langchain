    ## Welcome to LangChain [\#](\#welcome-to-langchain "Permalink to this headline")
    
    **LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model, but will also be:
    
    1. _Data-aware_: connect a language model to other sources of data
    
    2. _Agentic_: allow a language model to interact with its environment
    
    
    The LangChain framework is designed around these principles.
    
    This is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see [here](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/). For the JavaScript documentation, see [here](https://js.langchain.com/docs/).
    
    ## Getting Started [\#](\#getting-started "Permalink to this headline")
    
    How to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.
    
    - [Quickstart Guide](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html)
    
    
    Concepts and terminology.

    Tutorials created by community experts and presented on YouTube.

    ## Modules [\#](\#modules "Permalink to this headline")
    
    These modules are the core abstractions which we view as the building blocks of any LLM-powered application.
    
    For each module LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces. LanghChain also provides external integrations and even end-to-end implementations for off-the-shelf use.
    
    The docs for each module contain quickstart examples, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.
    
    The modules are (from least to most complex):
    
    - [Models](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models.html): Supported model types and integrations.
    
    - [Prompts](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts.html): Prompt management, optimization, and serialization.
    
    - [Memory](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/memory.html): Memory refers to state that is persisted between calls of a chain/agent.
    
    - [Indexes](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes.html): Language models become much more powerful when combined with application-specific data - this module contains interfaces and integrations for loading, querying and updating external data.
    
    - [Chains](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains.html): Chains are structured sequences of calls (to an LLM or to a different utility).
    
    - [Agents](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents.html): An agent is a Chain in which an LLM, given a high-level directive and a set of tools, repeatedly decides an action, executes the action and observes the outcome until the high-level directive is complete.
    
    - [Callbacks](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/callbacks/getting_started.html): Callbacks let you log and stream the intermediate steps of any chain, making it easy to observe, debug, and evaluate the internals of an application.
    
    
    ## Use Cases [\#](\#use-cases "Permalink to this headline")
    
    Best practices and built-in implementations for common LangChain use cases:
    
    - [Autonomous Agents](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/autonomous_agents.html): Autonomous agents are long-running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.
    
    - [Agent Simulations](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/agent_simulations.html): Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other and react to events can be an effective way to evaluate their long-range reasoning and planning abilities.
    
    - [Personal Assistants](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/personal_assistants.html): One of the primary LangChain use cases. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.
    
    - [Question Answering](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/question_answering.html): Another common LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.
    
    - [Chatbots](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/chatbots.html): Language models love to chat, making this a very natural use of them.
    
    - [Querying Tabular Data](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/tabular.html): Recommended reading if you want to use language models to query structured data (CSVs, SQL, dataframes, etc).
    
    - [Code Understanding](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/code.html): Recommended reading if you want to use language models to analyze code.
    
    - [Interacting with APIs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/apis.html): Enabling language models to interact with APIs is extremely powerful. It gives them access to up-to-date information and allows them to take actions.
    
    - [Extraction](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/extraction.html): Extract structured information from text.
    
    - [Summarization](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/summarization.html): Compressing longer documents. A type of Data-Augmented Generation.
    
    - [Evaluation](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/evaluation.html): Generative models are hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One promising approach is to use language models themselves to do the evaluation.
