# OpenSearch

> [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) is a scalable, flexible, and extensible open-source software suite for search, analytics, and observability applications licensed under Apache 2.0. `OpenSearch` is a distributed search and analytics engine based on `Apache Lucene`.


This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the `OpenSearch` database.

To run, you should have an OpenSearch instance up and running: [see here for an easy Docker installation](https://hub.docker.com/r/opensearchproject/opensearch).

`similarity_search` by default performs the Approximate k-NN Search which uses one of the several algorithms like lucene, nmslib, faiss recommended for
large datasets. To perform brute force search we have other search methods known as Script Scoring and Painless Scripting.
Check [this](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/knn/index/) for more details.

## Installation
Install the Python client.


```bash
pip install opensearch-py
```

We want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.


```python
import os
import getpass

os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = getpass.getpass('OpenAI API Key:')
```


```python
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import OpenSearchVectorSearch
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
```


```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
loader = TextLoader('../../../state_of_the_union.txt')
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```

### similarity_search using Approximate k-NN

`similarity_search` using `Approximate k-NN` Search with Custom Parameters


```python
docsearch = OpenSearchVectorSearch.from_documents(
    docs, 
    embeddings, 
    opensearch_url="http://localhost:9200"
)

# If using the default Docker installation, use this instantiation instead:
# docsearch = OpenSearchVectorSearch.from_documents(
#     docs, 
#     embeddings, 
#     opensearch_url="https://localhost:9200", 
#     http_auth=("admin", "admin"),     
#     use_ssl = False,
#     verify_certs = False,
#     ssl_assert_hostname = False,
#     ssl_show_warn = False,
# )
```


```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = docsearch.similarity_search(query, k=10)
```


```python
print(docs[0].page_content)
```


```python
docsearch = OpenSearchVectorSearch.from_documents(docs, embeddings, opensearch_url="http://localhost:9200", engine="faiss", space_type="innerproduct", ef_construction=256, m=48)

query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = docsearch.similarity_search(query)
```


```python
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

### similarity_search using Script Scoring

`similarity_search` using `Script Scoring` with Custom Parameters


```python
docsearch = OpenSearchVectorSearch.from_documents(docs, embeddings, opensearch_url="http://localhost:9200", is_appx_search=False)

query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = docsearch.similarity_search("What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson", k=1, search_type="script_scoring")
```


```python
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

### similarity_search using Painless Scripting

`similarity_search` using `Painless Scripting` with Custom Parameters


```python
docsearch = OpenSearchVectorSearch.from_documents(docs, embeddings, opensearch_url="http://localhost:9200", is_appx_search=False)
filter = {"bool": {"filter": {"term": {"text": "smuggling"}}}}
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = docsearch.similarity_search("What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson", search_type="painless_scripting", space_type="cosineSimilarity", pre_filter=filter)
```


```python
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

### Using a preexisting OpenSearch instance

It's also possible to use a preexisting OpenSearch instance with documents that already have vectors present.


```python
# this is just an example, you would need to change these values to point to another opensearch instance
docsearch = OpenSearchVectorSearch(index_name="index-*", embedding_function=embeddings, opensearch_url="http://localhost:9200")

# you can specify custom field names to match the fields you're using to store your embedding, document text value, and metadata
docs = docsearch.similarity_search("Who was asking about getting lunch today?", search_type="script_scoring", space_type="cosinesimil", vector_field="message_embedding", text_field="message", metadata_field="message_metadata")
```
