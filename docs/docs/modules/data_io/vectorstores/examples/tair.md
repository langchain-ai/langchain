# Tair

>[Tair](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/tair/latest/what-is-tair) is a cloud native in-memory database service developed by `Alibaba Cloud`. 
It provides rich data models and enterprise-grade capabilities to support your real-time online scenarios while maintaining full compatibility with open source `Redis`. `Tair` also introduces persistent memory-optimized instances that are based on the new non-volatile memory (NVM) storage medium.

This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the `Tair` vector database.

To run, you should have a `Tair` instance up and running.

```python
from langchain.embeddings.fake import FakeEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import Tair
```


```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
loader = TextLoader('../../../state_of_the_union.txt')
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = FakeEmbeddings(size=128)
```

Connect to Tair using the `TAIR_URL` environment variable 
```
export TAIR_URL="redis://{username}:{password}@{tair_address}:{tair_port}"
```

or the keyword argument `tair_url`.

Then store documents and embeddings into Tair.


```python
tair_url = "redis://localhost:6379"

# drop first if index already exists
Tair.drop_index(tair_url=tair_url)

vector_store = Tair.from_documents(
    docs,
    embeddings,
    tair_url=tair_url
)
```

Query similar documents.


```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query)
docs[0]
```
