# Annoy

> [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) (`Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah`) is a C++ library with Python bindings to search for points in space that are close to a given query point. It also creates large read-only file-based data structures that are mmapped into memory so that many processes may share the same data.

This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the `Annoy` vector database.

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->

```{note}
NOTE: Annoy is read-only - once the index is built you cannot add any more emebddings!
If you want to progressively add new entries to your VectorStore then better choose an alternative!
```


```python
#!pip install annoy
```

## Create VectorStore from texts


```python
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Annoy

embeddings_func = HuggingFaceEmbeddings()
```


```python
texts = ["pizza is great", "I love salad", "my car", "a dog"]

# default metric is angular
vector_store = Annoy.from_texts(texts, embeddings_func)
```


```python
# allows for custom annoy parameters, defaults are n_trees=100, n_jobs=-1, metric="angular"
vector_store_v2 = Annoy.from_texts(
    texts, embeddings_func, metric="dot", n_trees=100, n_jobs=1
)
```


```python
vector_store.similarity_search("food", k=3)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    [Document(page_content='pizza is great', metadata={}),
     Document(page_content='I love salad', metadata={}),
     Document(page_content='my car', metadata={})]
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
# the score is a distance metric, so lower is better
vector_store.similarity_search_with_score("food", k=3)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```

     (Document(page_content='my car', metadata={}), 1.1580758094787598)]

## Create VectorStore from docs


```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter

loader = TextLoader("../../../state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
```


```python
docs[:5]
```
