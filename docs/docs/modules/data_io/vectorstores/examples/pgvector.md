# PGVector

>[PGVector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) is an open-source vector similarity search for `Postgres`

It supports:
- exact and approximate nearest neighbor search
- L2 distance, inner product, and cosine distance

This notebook shows how to use the Postgres vector database (`PGVector`).

We want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.


```python
import os
import getpass

os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = getpass.getpass('OpenAI API Key:')
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

## Loading Environment Variables
from typing import List, Tuple

## Similarity search with score

### Similarity Search with Euclidean Distance (Default)


```python
# The PGVector Module will try to create a table with the name of the collection. So, make sure that the collection name is unique and the user has the 
# permission to create a table.

db = PGVector.from_documents(
    embedding=embeddings,
    documents=docs,
    collection_name="state_of_the_union",
    connection_string=CONNECTION_STRING,
)

query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs_with_score: List[Tuple[Document, float]] = db.similarity_search_with_score(query)
```


```python
for doc, score in docs_with_score:
    print("-" * 80)
    print("Score: ", score)
    print(doc.page_content)
    print("-" * 80)
```

## Working with vectorstore in PG

### Uploading a vectorstore in PG 


```python
data=docs
api_key=os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']

    distance_strategy=DistanceStrategy.COSINE,
    openai_api_key=api_key,
    pre_delete_collection=False 
)
```

### Retrieving a vectorstore in PG


```python
connection_string = CONNECTION_STRING 
embedding=embeddings

from langchain.vectorstores.pgvector import DistanceStrategy
store = PGVector(
    connection_string=connection_string, 
    embedding_function=embedding, 
    collection_name=collection_name,
    distance_strategy=DistanceStrategy.COSINE

retriever = store.as_retriever()
```


```python
print(retriever)
