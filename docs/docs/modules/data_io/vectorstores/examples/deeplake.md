#  Deep Lake

>[Deep Lake](https://docs.activeloop.ai/) as a Multi-Modal Vector Store that stores embeddings and their metadata including text, jsons, images, audio, video, and more. It saves the data locally, in your cloud, or on Activeloop storage. It performs hybrid search including embeddings and their attributes.

This notebook showcases basic functionality related to `Deep Lake`. While `Deep Lake` can store embeddings, it is capable of storing any type of data. It is a fully fledged serverless data lake with version control, query engine and streaming dataloader to deep learning frameworks.  

For more information, please see the Deep Lake [documentation](https://docs.activeloop.ai) or [api reference](https://docs.deeplake.ai)

```

Create a dataset locally at `./deeplake/`, then run similiarity search. The Deeplake+LangChain integration uses Deep Lake datasets under the hood, so `dataset` and `vector store` are used interchangeably. To create a dataset in your own cloud, or in the Deep Lake storage, [adjust the path accordingly](https://docs.activeloop.ai/storage-and-credentials/storage-options).


```python
db = DeepLake(dataset_path="./my_deeplake/", embedding_function=embeddings)
db.add_documents(docs)
# or shorter
# db = DeepLake.from_documents(docs, dataset_path="./my_deeplake/", embedding=embeddings, overwrite=True)
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = db.similarity_search(query)

Deep Lake, for now, is single writer and multiple reader. Setting `read_only=True` helps to avoid acquring the writer lock.

## Deep Lake datasets on cloud (Activeloop, AWS, GCS, etc.) or in memory
By default deep lake datasets are stored locally, in case you want to store them in memory, in the Deep Lake Managed DB, or in any object storage, you can provide the [corresponding path to the dataset](https://docs.activeloop.ai/storage-and-credentials/storage-options). You can retrieve your user token from [app.activeloop.ai](https://app.activeloop.ai/)


```python
