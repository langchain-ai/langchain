# OpenAPI Chain

This notebook shows an example of using an OpenAPI chain to call an endpoint in natural language, and get back a response in natural language.

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->


```python
from langchain.tools import OpenAPISpec, APIOperation
from langchain.chains import OpenAPIEndpointChain
from langchain.requests import Requests
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
```

## Load the spec

Load a wrapper of the spec (so we can work with it more easily). You can load from a url or from a local file.


```python
spec = OpenAPISpec.from_url("https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/public/openai/v0/api-docs/")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Attempting to load an OpenAPI 3.0.1 spec.  This may result in degraded performance. Convert your OpenAPI spec to 3.1.* spec for better support.
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
# Alternative loading from file
# spec = OpenAPISpec.from_file("openai_openapi.yaml")
```

## Select the Operation

In order to provide a focused on modular chain, we create a chain specifically only for one of the endpoints. Here we get an API operation from a specified endpoint and method.


```python
operation = APIOperation.from_openapi_spec(spec, '/public/openai/v0/products', "get")
```

## Construct the chain

We can now construct a chain to interact with it. In order to construct such a chain, we will pass in:

1. The operation endpoint
2. A requests wrapper (can be used to handle authentication, etc)
3. The LLM to use to interact with it


```python
llm = OpenAI() # Load a Language Model
```


```python
chain = OpenAPIEndpointChain.from_api_operation(
    operation, 
    llm, 
    requests=Requests(), 
    verbose=True,
    return_intermediate_steps=True # Return request and response text
)
```


```python
output = chain("whats the most expensive shirt?")
```

    You MUST strictly comply to the types indicated by the provided schema, including all required args.
    
    If you don't have sufficient information to call the function due to things like requiring specific uuid's, you can reply with the following message:

## Return raw response

We can also run this chain without synthesizing the response. This will have the effect of just returning the raw API output.


```python
