```python
from langchain.chains import PALChain
from langchain import OpenAI
```


```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, max_tokens=512)
```

## Math Prompt


```python
pal_chain = PALChain.from_math_prompt(llm, verbose=True)
```


```python
question = "Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. If Cindy has four pets, how many total pets do the three have?"
```


```python
pal_chain.run(question)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new PALChain chain...
    def solution():
        """Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. If Cindy has four pets, how many total pets do the three have?"""
        cindy_pets = 4
        marcia_pets = cindy_pets + 2
        jan_pets = marcia_pets * 3
        total_pets = cindy_pets + marcia_pets + jan_pets
        result = total_pets
        return result
    
    > Finished chain.

## Colored Objects


```python
pal_chain = PALChain.from_colored_object_prompt(llm, verbose=True)
```


```python
question = "On the desk, you see two blue booklets, two purple booklets, and two yellow pairs of sunglasses. If I remove all the pairs of sunglasses from the desk, how many purple items remain on it?"
```


```python
pal_chain.run(question)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new PALChain chain...
    # Put objects into a list to record ordering
    objects = []
    objects += [('booklet', 'blue')] * 2
    objects += [('booklet', 'purple')] * 2
    objects += [('sunglasses', 'yellow')] * 2
    
    # Remove all pairs of sunglasses
    objects = [object for object in objects if object[0] != 'sunglasses']
    
    # Count number of purple objects
    num_purple = len([object for object in objects if object[1] == 'purple'])
    answer = num_purple
    
    > Finished PALChain chain.





    '2'

## Intermediate Steps
You can also use the intermediate steps flag to return the code executed that generates the answer.


```python
pal_chain = PALChain.from_colored_object_prompt(llm, verbose=True, return_intermediate_steps=True)
```


```python
question = "On the desk, you see two blue booklets, two purple booklets, and two yellow pairs of sunglasses. If I remove all the pairs of sunglasses from the desk, how many purple items remain on it?"
```


```python
result = pal_chain({"question": question})
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new PALChain chain...
    # Put objects into a list to record ordering
    objects = []
    objects += [('booklet', 'blue')] * 2
    objects += [('booklet', 'purple')] * 2
    objects += [('sunglasses', 'yellow')] * 2
    
    # Remove all pairs of sunglasses
    objects = [object for object in objects if object[0] != 'sunglasses']
    
    # Count number of purple objects
    num_purple = len([object for object in objects if object[1] == 'purple'])
    answer = num_purple
    
    > Finished chain.
```

```python

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">
