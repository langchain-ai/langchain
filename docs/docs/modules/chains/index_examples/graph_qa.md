# Graph QA

This notebook goes over how to do question answering over a graph data structure.

## Create the graph

In this section, we construct an example graph. At the moment, this works best for small pieces of text.


```python
from langchain.indexes import GraphIndexCreator
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
```


```python
index_creator = GraphIndexCreator(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0))
```


```python
with open("../../state_of_the_union.txt") as f:
    all_text = f.read()
```

We will use just a small snippet, because extracting the knowledge triplets is a bit intensive at the moment.


```python
text = "\n".join(all_text.split("\n\n")[105:108])
```


```python
text
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    'It won’t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “Field of dreams,” the ground on which America’s future will be built. \nThis is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20 billion semiconductor “mega site”. \nUp to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. 10,000 new good-paying jobs. '
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
graph = index_creator.from_text(text)
```

We can inspect the created graph.


```python
graph.get_triples()
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    [('Intel', '$20 billion semiconductor "mega site"', 'is going to build'),
     ('Intel', 'state-of-the-art factories', 'is building'),
     ('Intel', '10,000 new good-paying jobs', 'is creating'),
     ('Intel', 'Silicon Valley', 'is helping build'),
     ('Field of dreams',
      "America's future will be built",
      'is the ground on which')]
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## Querying the graph
We can now use the graph QA chain to ask question of the graph


```python
from langchain.chains import GraphQAChain
```


```python
chain = GraphQAChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), graph=graph, verbose=True)
```


```python
chain.run("what is Intel going to build?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new GraphQAChain chain...
    Entities Extracted:
     Intel
    Full Context:
    Intel is going to build $20 billion semiconductor "mega site"
    Intel is building state-of-the-art factories
    Intel is creating 10,000 new good-paying jobs
    Intel is helping build Silicon Valley
    
    > Finished chain.





    ' Intel is going to build a $20 billion semiconductor "mega site" with state-of-the-art factories, creating 10,000 new good-paying jobs and helping to build Silicon Valley.'
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## Save the graph
We can also save and load the graph.


```python
graph.write_to_gml("graph.gml")
```


```python
from langchain.indexes.graph import NetworkxEntityGraph
```


```python
loaded_graph = NetworkxEntityGraph.from_gml("graph.gml")
```


```python
loaded_graph.get_triples()
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    [('Intel', '$20 billion semiconductor "mega site"', 'is going to build'),
     ('Intel', 'state-of-the-art factories', 'is building'),
     ('Intel', '10,000 new good-paying jobs', 'is creating'),
     ('Intel', 'Silicon Valley', 'is helping build'),
     ('Field of dreams',
      "America's future will be built",
      'is the ground on which')]
```
