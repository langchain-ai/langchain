    "* frame_skip (Default: None): Choose how many video frames to skip during processing. Increasing it results in faster execution, but less accurate results. If None, frame skip is calculated manually based on the framerate Set this to 0 to sample all frames\n",
    "* image_delta_threshold (Default: 3000000): Set the sensitivity for what the image processor considers a change in scenery in the video, used to delimit closed captions. Higher = less sensitive\n",
    "* closed_caption_char_limit (Default: 20): Sets the character limit on closed captions\n",
    "* closed_caption_similarity_threshold (Default: 80): Sets the percentage value to how similar two closed caption models should be in order to be clustered into one longer closed caption\n",
    "* use_unclustered_video_models (Default: False): If true, closed captions that could not be clustered will be included. May result in spontaneous behaviour from closed captions such as very short lasting captions or fast-changing captions. Enabling this is experimental and not recommended"
