I'll be happy to help you with this math question.\\n\\nTo find the first prime number greater than 40 that satisfies the given condition, we need to follow a step-by-step approach. \\n\\nFirstly, let's list the prime numbers greater than 40:\\n41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, ...\\n\\nNow, we need to check if one plus each of these prime numbers is divisible by 3. We can do this by calculating the remainder when dividing each number by 3.\\n\\nFor 41, (41 + 1) % 3 = 42 % 3 = 0. It is divisible by 3.\\n\\nFor 43, (43 + 1) % 3 = 44 % 3 = 2. It is not divisible by 3.\\n\\nFor 47, (47 + 1) % 3 = 48 % 3 = 0. It is divisible by 3.\\n\\nSince 41 and 47 are both greater than 40 and satisfy the condition, the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 41.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer to the question is 41.\""
