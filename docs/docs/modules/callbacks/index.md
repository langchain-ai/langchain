# Callbacks

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->

LangChain provides a callbacks system that allows you to hook into the various stages of your LLM application. This is useful for logging, [monitoring](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/tracing.html), [streaming](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/llms/examples/streaming_llm.html), and other tasks.

You can subscribe to these events by using the `callbacks` argument available throughout the API. This argument is list of handler objects, which are expected to implement one or more of the methods described below in more detail. There are two main callbacks mechanisms:

* *Constructor callbacks* will be used for all calls made on that object, and will be scoped to that object only, i.e. if you pass a handler to the `LLMChain` constructor, it will not be used by the model attached to that chain. 
* *Request callbacks* will be used for that specific request only, and all sub-requests that it contains (eg. a call to an `LLMChain` triggers a call to a Model, which uses the same handler passed through). These are explicitly passed through.


**Advanced:** When you create a custom chain you can easily set it up to use the same callback system as all the built-in chains. 
`_call`, `_generate`, `_run`, and equivalent async methods on Chains / LLMs / Chat Models / Agents / Tools now receive a 2nd argument called `run_manager` which is bound to that run, and contains the logging methods that can be used by that object (i.e. `on_llm_new_token`). This is useful when constructing a custom chain. See this guide for more information on how to [create custom chains and use callbacks inside them.](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/generic/custom_chain.html)

`CallbackHandlers` are objects that implement the `CallbackHandler` interface, which has a method for each event that can be subscribed to. The `CallbackManager` will call the appropriate method on each handler when the event is triggered.

```python
class BaseCallbackHandler:
    """Base callback handler that can be used to handle callbacks from langchain."""

    def on_llm_start(
        self, serialized: Dict[str, Any], prompts: List[str], **kwargs: Any
    ) -> Any:
        """Run when LLM starts running."""

    def on_llm_new_token(self, token: str, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        """Run on new LLM token. Only available when streaming is enabled."""

    def on_llm_end(self, response: LLMResult, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        """Run when LLM ends running."""

    def on_llm_error(
        self, error: Union[Exception, KeyboardInterrupt], **kwargs: Any
    ) -> Any:
        """Run when LLM errors."""

    def on_chain_start(
        self, serialized: Dict[str, Any], inputs: Dict[str, Any], **kwargs: Any
    ) -> Any:
        """Run when chain starts running."""

    def on_chain_end(self, outputs: Dict[str, Any], **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        """Run when chain ends running."""

    def on_chain_error(
        self, error: Union[Exception, KeyboardInterrupt], **kwargs: Any
    ) -> Any:
        """Run when chain errors."""

    def on_tool_start(
        self, serialized: Dict[str, Any], input_str: str, **kwargs: Any
    ) -> Any:
        """Run when tool starts running."""

    def on_tool_end(self, output: str, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        """Run when tool ends running."""

    def on_tool_error(
        self, error: Union[Exception, KeyboardInterrupt], **kwargs: Any
    ) -> Any:
        """Run when tool errors."""

    def on_text(self, text: str, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        """Run on arbitrary text."""

    def on_agent_action(self, action: AgentAction, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        """Run on agent action."""

    def on_agent_finish(self, finish: AgentFinish, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        """Run on agent end."""
```

## How to use callbacks

The `callbacks` argument is available on most objects throughout the API (Chains, Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) in two different places:

- **Constructor callbacks**: defined in the constructor, eg. `LLMChain(callbacks=[handler])`, which will be used for all calls made on that object, and will be scoped to that object only, eg. if you pass a handler to the `LLMChain` constructor, it will not be used by the Model attached to that chain.
- **Request callbacks**: defined in the `call()`/`run()`/`apply()` methods used for issuing a request, eg. `chain.call(inputs, callbacks=[handler])`, which will be used for that specific request only, and all sub-requests that it contains (eg. a call to an LLMChain triggers a call to a Model, which uses the same handler passed in the `call()` method).

The `verbose` argument is available on most objects throughout the API (Chains, Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) as a constructor argument, eg. `LLMChain(verbose=True)`, and it is equivalent to passing a `ConsoleCallbackHandler` to the `callbacks` argument of that object and all child objects. This is useful for debugging, as it will log all events to the console.

### When do you want to use each of these?

- Constructor callbacks are most useful for use cases such as logging, monitoring, etc., which are _not specific to a single request_, but rather to the entire chain. For example, if you want to log all the requests made to an LLMChain, you would pass a handler to the constructor.
- Request callbacks are most useful for use cases such as streaming, where you want to stream the output of a single request to a specific websocket connection, or other similar use cases. For example, if you want to stream the output of a single request to a websocket, you would pass a handler to the `call()` method

## Using an existing handler

LangChain provides a few built-in handlers that you can use to get started. These are available in the `langchain/callbacks` module. The most basic handler is the `StdOutCallbackHandler`, which simply logs all events to `stdout`. In the future we will add more default handlers to the library. 

**Note** when the `verbose` flag on the object is set to true, the `StdOutCallbackHandler` will be invoked even without being explicitly passed in.


```python
from langchain.callbacks import StdOutCallbackHandler
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

handler = StdOutCallbackHandler()
llm = OpenAI()
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("1 + {number} = ")

# First, let's explicitly set the StdOutCallbackHandler in `callbacks`
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, callbacks=[handler])
chain.run(number=2)

# Then, let's use the `verbose` flag to achieve the same result
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True)
chain.run(number=2)

# Finally, let's use the request `callbacks` to achieve the same result
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
chain.run(number=2, callbacks=[handler])
```

## Creating a custom handler

You can create a custom handler to set on the object as well. In the example below, we'll implement streaming with a custom handler.


```python
from langchain.callbacks.base import BaseCallbackHandler
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage

class MyCustomHandler(BaseCallbackHandler):
    def on_llm_new_token(self, token: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        print(f"My custom handler, token: {token}")

# To enable streaming, we pass in `streaming=True` to the ChatModel constructor
# Additionally, we pass in a list with our custom handler
chat = ChatOpenAI(max_tokens=25, streaming=True, callbacks=[MyCustomHandler()])

chat([HumanMessage(content="Tell me a joke")])
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    My custom handler, token: 
    My custom handler, token: Why
    My custom handler, token:  did
    My custom handler, token:  the
    My custom handler, token:  tomato
    My custom handler, token:  turn
    My custom handler, token:  red
    My custom handler, token: ?
    My custom handler, token:  Because
    My custom handler, token:  it
    My custom handler, token:  saw
    My custom handler, token:  the
    My custom handler, token:  salad
    My custom handler, token:  dressing
    My custom handler, token: !
    My custom handler, token: 





    AIMessage(content='Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!', additional_kwargs={})
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## Async Callbacks

If you are planning to use the async API, it is recommended to use `AsyncCallbackHandler` to avoid blocking the runloop. 

**Advanced** if you use a sync `CallbackHandler` while using an async method to run your llm/chain/tool/agent, it will still work. However, under the hood, it will be called with [`run_in_executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.run_in_executor) which can cause issues if your `CallbackHandler` is not thread-safe.


```python
import asyncio
from typing import Any, Dict, List
from langchain.schema import LLMResult
from langchain.callbacks.base import AsyncCallbackHandler

class MyCustomSyncHandler(BaseCallbackHandler):
    def on_llm_new_token(self, token: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        print(f"Sync handler being called in a `thread_pool_executor`: token: {token}")

class MyCustomAsyncHandler(AsyncCallbackHandler):
    """Async callback handler that can be used to handle callbacks from langchain."""

    async def on_llm_start(
        self, serialized: Dict[str, Any], prompts: List[str], **kwargs: Any
    ) -> None:
        """Run when chain starts running."""
        print("zzzz....")
        await asyncio.sleep(0.3)
        class_name = serialized["name"]
        print("Hi! I just woke up. Your llm is starting")

    async def on_llm_end(self, response: LLMResult, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
        """Run when chain ends running."""
        print("zzzz....")
        await asyncio.sleep(0.3)
        print("Hi! I just woke up. Your llm is ending")

# To enable streaming, we pass in `streaming=True` to the ChatModel constructor
# Additionally, we pass in a list with our custom handler
chat = ChatOpenAI(max_tokens=25, streaming=True, callbacks=[MyCustomSyncHandler(), MyCustomAsyncHandler()])

await chat.agenerate([[HumanMessage(content="Tell me a joke")]])
```

## Using multiple handlers, passing in handlers

In the previous examples, we passed in callback handlers upon creation of an object by using `callbacks=`. In this case, the callbacks will be scoped to that particular object. 

However, in many cases, it is advantageous to pass in handlers instead when running the object. When we pass through `CallbackHandlers` using the `callbacks` keyword arg when executing an run, those callbacks will be issued by all nested objects involved in the execution. For example, when a handler is passed through to an `Agent`, it will be used for all callbacks related to the agent and all the objects involved in the agent's execution, in this case, the `Tools`, `LLMChain`, and `LLM`.

This prevents us from having to manually attach the handlers to each individual nested object.


```python
from typing import Dict, Union, Any, List

from langchain.callbacks.base import BaseCallbackHandler
from langchain.schema import AgentAction
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools
from langchain.callbacks import tracing_enabled

    ) -> Any:
        print(f"on_llm_start {serialized['name']}")

    def on_llm_new_token(self, token: str, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:

    def on_llm_error(

    def on_agent_action(self, action: AgentAction, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        print(f"on_agent_action {action}")

class MyCustomHandlerTwo(BaseCallbackHandler):
    def on_llm_start(
        self, serialized: Dict[str, Any], prompts: List[str], **kwargs: Any
    ) -> Any:
        print(f"on_llm_start (I'm the second handler!!) {serialized['name']}")

# Instantiate the handlers
handler1 = MyCustomHandlerOne()
handler2 = MyCustomHandlerTwo()

# Setup the agent. Only the `llm` will issue callbacks for handler2
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, streaming=True, callbacks=[handler2])
tools = load_tools(["llm-math"], llm=llm)
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION

# Callbacks for handler1 will be issued by every object involved in the 
# Agent execution (llm, llmchain, tool, agent executor)

# Tracing and Token Counting

Tracing and token counting are two capabilities we provide which are built on our callbacks mechanism.

## Tracing

There are two recommended ways to trace your LangChains:

1. Setting the `LANGCHAIN_TRACING` environment variable to `"true"`. 
2. Using a context manager `with tracing_enabled()` to trace a particular block of code.

**Note** if the environment variable is set, all code will be traced, regardless of whether or not it's within the context manager.


```python
import os

from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools
from langchain.callbacks import tracing_enabled
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# To run the code, make sure to set OPENAI_API_KEY and SERPAPI_API_KEY
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
tools = load_tools(["llm-math", "serpapi"], llm=llm)
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True
)

questions = [
    "Who won the US Open men's final in 2019? What is his age raised to the 0.334 power?",
    "Who is Olivia Wilde's boyfriend? What is his current age raised to the 0.23 power?",
    "Who won the most recent formula 1 grand prix? What is their age raised to the 0.23 power?",
    "Who won the US Open women's final in 2019? What is her age raised to the 0.34 power?",
    "Who is Beyonce's husband? What is his age raised to the 0.19 power?",
]
```


```python
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING"] = "true"

# Both of the agent runs will be traced because the environment variable is set
agent.run(questions[0])
with tracing_enabled() as session:
    assert session
    agent.run(questions[1])
```

## Token Counting
LangChain offers a context manager that allows you to count tokens.


```python
from langchain.callbacks import get_openai_callback

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
with get_openai_callback() as cb:
    llm("What is the square root of 4?")

total_tokens = cb.total_tokens
assert total_tokens > 0

with get_openai_callback() as cb:
    llm("What is the square root of 4?")
    llm("What is the square root of 4?")

assert cb.total_tokens == total_tokens * 2

# You can kick off concurrent runs from within the context manager
with get_openai_callback() as cb:
    await asyncio.gather(
        *[llm.agenerate(["What is the square root of 4?"]) for _ in range(3)]
    )

assert cb.total_tokens == total_tokens * 3

# The context manager is concurrency safe
task = asyncio.create_task(llm.agenerate(["What is the square root of 4?"]))
with get_openai_callback() as cb:
    await llm.agenerate(["What is the square root of 4?"])

await task
assert cb.total_tokens == total_tokens
```
