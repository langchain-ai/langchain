# Motörhead Memory (Managed)
[Motörhead](https://github.com/getmetal/motorhead) is a memory server implemented in Rust. It automatically handles incremental summarization in the background and allows for stateless applications.

## Setup

See instructions at [Motörhead](https://docs.getmetal.io/motorhead/introduction) for running the managed version of Motorhead. You can retrieve your `api_key` and `client_id` by creating an account on [Metal](https://getmetal.io).
