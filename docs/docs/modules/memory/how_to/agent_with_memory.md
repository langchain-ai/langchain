# How to add Memory to an Agent

This notebook goes over adding memory to an Agent. Before going through this notebook, please walkthrough the following notebooks, as this will build on top of both of them:

- [Adding memory to an LLM Chain](adding_memory.ipynb)
- [Custom Agents](../../agents/agents/how_to/custom_agent.ipynb)

In order to add a memory to an agent we are going to the the following steps:

1. We are going to create an LLMChain with memory.
2. We are going to use that LLMChain to create a custom Agent.

For the purposes of this exercise, we are going to create a simple custom Agent that has access to a search tool and utilizes the `ConversationBufferMemory` class.

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->


```python
from langchain.agents import ZeroShotAgent, Tool, AgentExecutor
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain import OpenAI, LLMChain
from langchain.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper
```


```python
search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name = "Search",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"
    )
]
```

Notice the usage of the `chat_history` variable in the PromptTemplate, which matches up with the dynamic key name in the ConversationBufferMemory.


```python
prefix = """Have a conversation with a human, answering the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:"""
suffix = """Begin!"

{chat_history}
Question: {input}
{agent_scratchpad}"""

prompt = ZeroShotAgent.create_prompt(
    tools, 
    prefix=prefix, 
    suffix=suffix, 
    input_variables=["input", "chat_history", "agent_scratchpad"]
)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history")
```

We can now construct the LLMChain, with the Memory object, and then create the agent.


```python
llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), prompt=prompt)
agent = ZeroShotAgent(llm_chain=llm_chain, tools=tools, verbose=True)
agent_chain = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True, memory=memory)
```


```python
agent_chain.run(input="How many people live in canada?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

To test the memory of this agent, we can ask a followup question that relies on information in the previous exchange to be answered correctly.


```python
agent_chain.run(input="what is their national anthem called?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

We can see that the agent remembered that the previous question was about Canada, and properly asked Google Search what the name of Canada's national anthem was.

For fun, let's compare this to an agent that does NOT have memory.


```python
prefix = """Have a conversation with a human, answering the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:"""
suffix = """Begin!"

Question: {input}
{agent_scratchpad}"""

prompt = ZeroShotAgent.create_prompt(
    tools, 
    prefix=prefix, 
    suffix=suffix, 
    input_variables=["input", "agent_scratchpad"]
)
llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), prompt=prompt)
agent = ZeroShotAgent(llm_chain=llm_chain, tools=tools, verbose=True)
agent_without_memory = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)
```


```python
agent_without_memory.run("How many people live in canada?")
