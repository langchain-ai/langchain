# How to add memory to a Multi-Input Chain

Most memory objects assume a single input. In this notebook, we go over how to add memory to a chain that has multiple inputs. As an example of such a chain, we will add memory to a question/answering chain. This chain takes as inputs both related documents and a user question.
