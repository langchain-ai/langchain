# ConversationSummaryBufferMemory

`ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` combines the last two ideas. It keeps a buffer of recent interactions in memory, but rather than just completely flushing old interactions it compiles them into a summary and uses both. Unlike the previous implementation though, it uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions.

Let's first walk through how to use the utilities

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->


```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
llm = OpenAI()
```


```python
memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})
```


```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'history': 'System: \nThe human says "hi", and the AI responds with "whats up".\nHuman: not much you\nAI: not much'}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model).


```python
memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10, return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})
```

We can also utilize the `predict_new_summary` method directly.


```python
messages = memory.chat_memory.messages
previous_summary = ""
memory.predict_new_summary(messages, previous_summary)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    '\nThe human and AI state that they are not doing much.'
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## Using in a chain
Let's walk through an example, again setting `verbose=True` so we can see the prompt.


```python
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
conversation_with_summary = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm, 
    # We set a very low max_token_limit for the purposes of testing.
    memory=ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=OpenAI(), max_token_limit=40),
    verbose=True
)
conversation_with_summary.predict(input="Hi, what's up?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new ConversationChain chain...
    Prompt after formatting:
    The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.
    
    Current conversation:
    
    Human: Hi, what's up?
    AI:
    
    > Finished chain.





    " Hi there! I'm doing great. I'm learning about the latest advances in artificial intelligence. What about you?"
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
conversation_with_summary.predict(input="Just working on writing some documentation!")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

    ' That sounds like a great use of your time. Do you have experience with writing documentation?'

    Human: For LangChain! Have you heard of it?

    " No, I haven't heard of LangChain. Can you tell me more about it?"
```

```python
# We can see here that the summary and the buffer are updated
