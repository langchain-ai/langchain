    "# HTMLSectionSplitter\n",
    "## Description and motivation\n",
    "Similar in concept to the <a href=\"https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/HTML_header_metadata\">`HTMLHeaderTextSplitter`</a>, the `HTMLSectionSplitter` is a \"structure-aware\" chunker that splits text at the element level and adds metadata for each header \"relevant\" to any given chunk. It can return chunks element by element or combine elements with the same metadata, with the objectives of (a) keeping related text grouped (more or less) semantically and (b) preserving context-rich information encoded in document structures. It can be used with other text splitters as part of a chunking pipeline. Internally, it uses the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` when the section size is larger than the chunk size. It also considers the font size of the text to determine whether it is a section or not based on the determined font size threshold. Use `xslt_path` to provide an absolute path to transform the HTML so that it can detect sections based on provided tags. The default is to use the `converting_to_header.xslt` file in the `data_connection/document_transformers` directory. This is for converting the html to a format/layout that is easier to detect sections. For example, `span` based on their font size can be converted to header tags to be detected as a section.\n",
