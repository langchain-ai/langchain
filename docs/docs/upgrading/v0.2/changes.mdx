# Deprecations and Breaking Changes

This code contains a list of deprecations and removals in the `langchain` and `langchain-core` packages.

## Breaking Changes in 0.2.0

As of release 0.2.0, `langchain` is required to be integration-agnostic. This means that code in `langchain`  should not by default instantiate any specific chat models, llms, embedding models, vectorstores etc; instead, the user will be required to specify those explicitly.

The following functions and classes require an explicit LLM to be passed as an argument:

- `langchain.agents.agent_toolkits.vectorstore.toolkit.VectorStoreToolkit`
- `langchain.agents.agent_toolkits.vectorstore.toolkit.VectorStoreRouterToolkit`
- `langchain.chains.openai_functions.get_openapi_chain`
- `langchain.chains.router.MultiRetrievalQAChain.from_retrievers`
- `langchain.indexes.VectorStoreIndexWrapper.query`
- `langchain.indexes.VectorStoreIndexWrapper.query_with_sources`
- `langchain.indexes.VectorStoreIndexWrapper.aquery_with_sources`
- `langchain.chains.flare.FlareChain`



The following classes now require passing an explicit Embedding model as an argument:

- `langchain.indexes.VectostoreIndexCreator`

The following code has been removed:

- `langchain.natbot.NatBotChain.from_default` removed in favor of the `from_llm` class method.


## Deprecations

We have two main types of deprecations:

1. Code that was moved from `langchain` into another package (e.g, `langchain-community`)

    If you try to import it from `langchain`, the import will keep on working, but will raise a deprecation warning. The warning will provide a replacement import statement.

    ```python
    python -c "from langchain.document_loaders.markdown import UnstructuredMarkdownLoader"
    ```

    ```python
    LangChainDeprecationWarning: Importing UnstructuredMarkdownLoader from langchain.document_loaders is deprecated. Please replace deprecated imports:

    >> from langchain.document_loaders import UnstructuredMarkdownLoader

    with new imports of:

    >> from langchain_community.document_loaders import UnstructuredMarkdownLoader
    ```

    We will continue supporting the imports in `langchain` until release 0.4 as long as the relevant package where the code lives is installed. (e.g., as long as `langchain_community` is installed.)

    However, we advise for users to not rely on these imports and instead migrate to the new imports. To help with this process, we’re releasing a migration script via the LangChain CLI. See further instructions in migration guide.

2. Code that has better alternatives available and will eventually be removed, so there’s only a single way to do things. (e.g., `predict_messages` method in ChatModels has been deprecated in favor of `invoke`).

    Many of these were marked for removal in 0.2. We have bumped the removal to 0.3.
