    "# Migrating from ConversationalRetrievalChain\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`ConversationalRetrievalChain`](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.conversational_retrieval.base.ConversationalRetrievalChain.html) was an all-in one way that combined retrieval-augmented generation with chat history, allowing you to \"chat with\" your documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of switching to the LCEL implementation are similar to the [`RetrievalQA` migration guide](./retrieval_qa.ipynb):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clearer internals. The `ConversationalRetrievalChain` chain hides an entire question rephrasing step which dereferences the initial query against the chat history.\n",
    "  - This means the class contains two sets of configurable prompts, LLMs, etc.\n",
    "- More easily return source documents.\n",
    "- Support for runnable methods like streaming and async operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are equivalent implementations with custom prompts.\n",
    "We'll use the following ingestion code to load a [blog post by Lilian Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) on autonomous agents into a local vector store:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shared setup\n",
    "\n",
    "For both versions, we'll need to load the data with the `WebBaseLoader` document loader, split it with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, and add it to an in-memory `FAISS` vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also instantiate a chat model to use."
