    "# Migrating from ConstitutionalChain\n",
    "\n",
    "[ConstitutionalChain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.constitutional_ai.base.ConstitutionalChain.html) allowed for a LLM to critique and revise generations based on [principles](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.constitutional_ai.models.ConstitutionalPrinciple.html), structured as combinations of critique and revision requests. For example, a principle might include a request to identify harmful content, and a request to rewrite the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Constitutional AI principles` are based on the [Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08073) paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `ConstitutionalChain`, this structure of critique requests and associated revisions was formatted into a LLM prompt and parsed out of string responses. This is more naturally achieved via [structured output](/docs/how_to/structured_output/) features of chat models. We can construct a simple chain in [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) for this purpose. Some advantages of this approach include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Leverage tool-calling capabilities of chat models that have been fine-tuned for this purpose;\n",
    "- Reduce parsing errors from extracting expression from a string LLM response;\n",
    "- Delegation of instructions to [message roles](/docs/concepts/#messages) (e.g., chat models can understand what a `ToolMessage` represents without the need for additional prompting);\n",
    "- Support for streaming, both of individual tokens and chain steps."
