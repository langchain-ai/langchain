    "\n",
    "The [`RetrievalQA` chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.retrieval_qa.base.RetrievalQA.html) performed natural-language question answering over a data source using retrieval-augmented generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some advantages of switching to the LCEL implementation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easier customizability. Details such as the prompt and how documents are formatted are only configurable via specific parameters in the `RetrievalQA` chain.\n",
    "- More easily return source documents.\n",
    "- Support for runnable methods like streaming and async operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at them side-by-side. We'll use the following ingestion code to load a [blog post by Lilian Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) on autonomous agents into a local vector store:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shared setup\n",
