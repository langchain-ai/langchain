    "# Fallbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with language models, you may often encounter issues from the underlying APIs, whether these be rate limiting or downtime. Therefore, as you go to move your LLM applications into production it becomes more and more important to safeguard against these. That's why we've introduced the concept of fallbacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **fallback** is an alternative plan that may be used in an emergency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level. This is important because often times different models require different prompts. So if your call to OpenAI fails, you don't just want to send the same prompt to Anthropic - you probably want to use a different prompt template and send a different version there."

    "## Fallback for LLM API Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "This is maybe the most common use case for fallbacks. A request to an LLM API can fail for a variety of reasons - the API could be down, you could have hit rate limits, any number of things. Therefore, using fallbacks can help protect against these types of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT: By default, a lot of the LLM wrappers catch errors and retry. You will most likely want to turn those off when working with fallbacks. Otherwise the first wrapper will keep on retrying and not failing."
