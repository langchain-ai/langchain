            "We have already written about the importance of anonymizing sensitive data in the previous section. **Reversible Anonymization** is an equally essential technology while sharing information with language models, as it balances data protection with data usability. This technique involves masking sensitive personally identifiable information (PII), yet it can be reversed and original data can be restored when authorized users need it. Its main advantage lies in the fact that while it conceals individual identities to prevent misuse, it also allows the concealed data to be accurately unmasked should it be necessary for legal or compliance purposes. \n",

            "## Overview\n",
            "\n",
            "We implemented the `PresidioReversibleAnonymizer`, which consists of two parts:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. anonymization - it works the same way as `PresidioAnonymizer`, plus the object itself stores a mapping of made-up values to original ones, for example:\n",
            "```\n",
            "    {\n",
            "        \"PERSON\": {\n",
            "            \"<anonymized>\": \"<original>\",\n",
            "            \"John Doe\": \"Slim Shady\"\n",
            "        },\n",
            "        \"PHONE_NUMBER\": {\n",
            "            \"111-111-1111\": \"555-555-5555\"\n",
            "        }\n",
            "        ...\n",
            "    }\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "2. deanonymization - using the mapping described above, it matches fake data with original data and then substitutes it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Between anonymization and deanonymization user can perform different operations, for example, passing the output to LLM.\n",
