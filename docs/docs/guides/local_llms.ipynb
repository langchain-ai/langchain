    "# Run LLMs locally\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use case\n",
    "\n",
    "The popularity of projects like [PrivateGPT](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT), [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), and [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) underscore the demand to run LLMs locally (on your own device).\n",
    "\n",
    "This has at least two important benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Privacy`: Your data is not sent to a third party, and it is not subject to the terms of service of a commercial service\n",
    "2. `Cost`: There is no inference fee, which is important for token-intensive applications (e.g., [long-running simulations](https://twitter.com/RLanceMartin/status/1691097659262820352?s=20), summarization)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Running an LLM locally requires a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Open-source LLM`: An open-source LLM that can be freely modified and shared \n",
    "2. `Inference`: Ability to run this LLM on your device w/ acceptable latency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open-source LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can now gain access to a rapidly growing set of [open-source LLMs](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/the-history-of-open-source-llms-better). \n",
    "\n",
    "These LLMs can be assessed across at least two dimensions (see figure):\n",
    " \n",
    "1. `Base model`: What is the base-model and how was it trained?\n",
    "2. `Fine-tuning approach`: Was the base-model fine-tuned and, if so, what [set of instructions](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/beyond-llama-the-power-of-open-llms#%C2%A7alpaca-an-instruction-following-llama-model) was used?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image description](/img/OSS_LLM_overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative performance of these models can be assessed using several leaderboards, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [LmSys](https://chat.lmsys.org/?arena)\n",
    "2. [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/index.html)\n",
    "3. [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "A few frameworks for this have emerged to support inference of open-source LLMs on various devices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp): C++ implementation of llama inference code with [weight optimization / quantization](https://finbarr.ca/how-is-llama-cpp-possible/)\n",
    "2. [`gpt4all`](https://docs.gpt4all.io/index.html): Optimized C backend for inference\n",
    "3. [`Ollama`](https://ollama.ai/): Bundles model weights and environment into an app that runs on device and serves the LLM \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, these frameworks will do a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Quantization`: Reduce the memory footprint of the raw model weights\n",
    "2. `Efficient implementation for inference`: Support inference on consumer hardware (e.g., CPU or laptop GPU)\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, see [this excellent post](https://finbarr.ca/how-is-llama-cpp-possible/) on the importance of quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image description](/img/llama-memory-weights.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With less precision, we radically decrease the memory needed to store the LLM in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we can see the importance of GPU memory bandwidth [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OehfHHNSn66BP2h3Bxp2NJTVX97icU0GmCXF6pK23H8/edit#gid=0)!\n",
    "\n",
    "A Mac M2 Max is 5-6x faster than a M1 for inference due to the larger GPU memory bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image description](/img/llama_t_put.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "[`Ollama`](https://ollama.ai/) is one way to easily run inference on macOS.\n",
    " \n",
    "The instructions [here](docs/integrations/llms/ollama) provide details, which we summarize:\n",
    " \n",
    "* [Download and run](https://ollama.ai/download) the app\n",
    "* From command line, fetch a model from this [list of options](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama): e.g., `ollama pull llama2`\n",
    "* When the app is running, all models are automatically served on `localhost:11434`\n"
