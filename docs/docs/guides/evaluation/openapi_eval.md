# Evaluating an OpenAPI Chain

This notebook goes over ways to semantically evaluate an [OpenAPI Chain](openapi.ipynb), which calls an endpoint defined by the OpenAPI specification using purely natural language.

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->


```python
from langchain.tools import OpenAPISpec, APIOperation
from langchain.chains import OpenAPIEndpointChain, LLMChain
from langchain.requests import Requests
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
```

## Load the API Chain

Load a wrapper of the spec (so we can work with it more easily). You can load from a url or from a local file.


```python
# Load and parse the OpenAPI Spec
spec = OpenAPISpec.from_url("https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/public/openai/v0/api-docs/")
# Load a single endpoint operation
operation = APIOperation.from_openapi_spec(spec, '/public/openai/v0/products', "get")
verbose = False
# Select any LangChain LLM
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, max_tokens=1000)
# Create the endpoint chain
api_chain = OpenAPIEndpointChain.from_api_operation(
    operation, 
    llm, 
    requests=Requests(), 
    verbose=verbose,
    return_intermediate_steps=True # Return request and response text
)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Attempting to load an OpenAPI 3.0.1 spec.  This may result in degraded performance. Convert your OpenAPI spec to 3.1.* spec for better support.
```

### *Optional*: Generate Input Questions and Request Ground Truth Queries

See [Generating Test Datasets](#Generating-Test-Datasets) at the end of this notebook for more details.


```python
# import re
# from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# template = """Below is a service description:

# {spec}

# Imagine you're a new user trying to use {operation} through a search bar. What are 10 different things you want to request?
# Wants/Questions:
# 1. """

# prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)

# generation_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# questions_ = generation_chain.run(spec=operation.to_typescript(), operation=operation.operation_id).split('\n')
# # Strip preceding numeric bullets
# questions = [re.sub(r'^\d+\. ', '', q).strip() for q in questions_]
# questions
```


```python
# ground_truths = [
# {"q": ...} # What are the best queries for each input?
# ]
```

## Run the API Chain

The two simplest questions a user of the API Chain are:
- Did the chain succesfully access the endpoint?
- Did the action accomplish the correct result?



```python
from collections import defaultdict
# Collect metrics to report at completion
scores = defaultdict(list)
```

## Evaluate the requests chain

The API Chain has two main components:
1. Translate the user query to an API request (request synthesizer)
2. Translate the API response to a natural language response

Here, we construct an evaluation chain to grade the request synthesizer against selected human queries 


```python
import json
truth_queries = [json.dumps(data["expected_query"]) for data in dataset]
```


```python
# Collect the API queries generated by the chain
predicted_queries = [output["intermediate_steps"]["request_args"] for output in chain_outputs]
```


```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

template = """You are trying to answer the following question by querying an API:

> Question: {question}

The query you know you should be executing against the API is:

> Query: {truth_query}

Is the following predicted query semantically the same (eg likely to produce the same answer)?

> Predicted Query: {predict_query}

Please give the Predicted Query a grade of either an A, B, C, D, or F, along with an explanation of why. End the evaluation with 'Final Grade: <the letter>'

> Explanation: Let's think step by step."""

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)

eval_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=verbose)
```


```python
request_eval_results = []
for question, predict_query, truth_query in list(zip(questions, predicted_queries, truth_queries)):
    eval_output = eval_chain.run(
        question=question,
        truth_query=truth_query,
        predict_query=predict_query,
    )
    request_eval_results.append(eval_output)

## Generating Test Datasets

To evaluate a chain against your own endpoint, you'll want to generate a test dataset that's conforms to the API.

This section provides an overview of how to bootstrap the process.

First, we'll parse the OpenAPI Spec. For this example, we'll [Speak](https://www.speak.com/)'s OpenAPI specification.


```python
# Load and parse the OpenAPI Spec
spec = OpenAPISpec.from_url("https://api.speak.com/openapi.yaml")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Attempting to load an OpenAPI 3.0.1 spec.  This may result in degraded performance. Convert your OpenAPI spec to 3.1.* spec for better support.

```python
# List the paths in the OpenAPI Spec
paths = sorted(spec.paths.keys())
paths
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    ['/v1/public/openai/explain-phrase',
     '/v1/public/openai/explain-task',
     '/v1/public/openai/translate']
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
# See which HTTP Methods are available for a given path
methods = spec.get_methods_for_path('/v1/public/openai/explain-task')
methods
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    ['post']
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
# Load a single endpoint operation
operation = APIOperation.from_openapi_spec(spec, '/v1/public/openai/explain-task', 'post')

# The operation can be serialized as typescript
print(operation.to_typescript())
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    type explainTask = (_: {
    /* Description of the task that the user wants to accomplish or do. For example, "tell the waiter they messed up my order" or "compliment someone on their shirt" */
      task_description?: string,
    /* The foreign language that the user is learning and asking about. The value can be inferred from question - for example, if the user asks "how do i ask a girl out in mexico city", the value should be "Spanish" because of Mexico City. Always use the full name of the language (e.g. Spanish, French). */
      learning_language?: string,
    /* The user's native language. Infer this value from the language the user asked their question in. Always use the full name of the language (e.g. Spanish, French). */
