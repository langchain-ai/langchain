# Data Augmented Question Answering

This notebook uses some generic prompts/language models to evaluate an question answering system that uses other sources of data besides what is in the model. For example, this can be used to evaluate a question answering system over your proprietary data.

## Setup
Let's set up an example with our favorite example - the state of the union address.

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->


```python
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
```

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader

loader = TextLoader('../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt')
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
docsearch = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings)
qa = RetrievalQA.from_llm(llm=OpenAI(), retriever=docsearch.as_retriever())
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Running Chroma using direct local API.
    Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## Examples
Now we need some examples to evaluate. We can do this in two ways:

1. Hard code some examples ourselves
2. Generate examples automatically, using a language model


```python
# Hard-coded examples
examples = [
    {
        "query": "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson",
        "answer": "He praised her legal ability and said he nominated her for the supreme court."
    },
    {
        "query": "What did the president say about Michael Jackson",
        "answer": "Nothing"
    }
]
```


```python
# Generated examples
from langchain.evaluation.qa import QAGenerateChain
example_gen_chain = QAGenerateChain.from_llm(OpenAI())
```


```python
new_examples = example_gen_chain.apply_and_parse([{"doc": t} for t in texts[:5]])
```


```python
new_examples
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    [{'query': 'According to the document, what did Vladimir Putin miscalculate?',
      'answer': 'He miscalculated that he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over.'},
     {'query': 'Who is the Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States?',
      'answer': 'The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight.'},
     {'query': 'How many countries were part of the coalition formed to confront Putin?',
      'answer': '27 members of the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland.'},
     {'query': 'What action is the U.S. Department of Justice taking to target Russian oligarchs?',
      'answer': 'The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs and joining with European allies to find and seize their yachts, luxury apartments, and private jets.'},
     {'query': 'How much direct assistance is the United States providing to Ukraine?',
      'answer': 'The United States is providing more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine.'}]
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
# Combine examples
examples += new_examples
```

## Evaluate
Now that we have examples, we can use the question answering evaluator to evaluate our question answering chain.


```python
from langchain.evaluation.qa import QAEvalChain
```


```python
predictions = qa.apply(examples)
```


```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
eval_chain = QAEvalChain.from_llm(llm)
```


```python
graded_outputs = eval_chain.evaluate(examples, predictions)
```


```python
for i, eg in enumerate(examples):
    print(f"Example {i}:")
    print("Question: " + predictions[i]['query'])
    print("Real Answer: " + predictions[i]['answer'])
    print("Predicted Answer: " + predictions[i]['result'])
    print("Predicted Grade: " + graded_outputs[i]['text'])
    print()
```

    Example 0:
    Question: What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson
    Real Answer: He praised her legal ability and said he nominated her for the supreme court.
    Predicted Answer:  The president said that she is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators and police officers. He also said that she is a consensus builder and that she has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by both Democrats and Republicans.

## Evaluate with Other Metrics

In addition to predicting whether the answer is correct or incorrect using a language model, we can also use other metrics to get a more nuanced view on the quality of the answers. To do so, we can use the [Critique](https://docs.inspiredco.ai/critique/) library, which allows for simple calculation of various metrics over generated text.

First you can get an API key from the [Inspired Cognition Dashboard](https://dashboard.inspiredco.ai) and do some setup:

```bash
export INSPIREDCO_API_KEY="..."
pip install inspiredco
```


```python
import inspiredco.critique
import os
critique = inspiredco.critique.Critique(api_key=os.environ['INSPIREDCO_API_KEY'])
```

Then run the following code to set up the configuration and calculate the [ROUGE](https://docs.inspiredco.ai/critique/metric_rouge.html), [chrf](https://docs.inspiredco.ai/critique/metric_chrf.html), [BERTScore](https://docs.inspiredco.ai/critique/metric_bert_score.html), and [UniEval](https://docs.inspiredco.ai/critique/metric_uni_eval.html) (you can choose [other metrics](https://docs.inspiredco.ai/critique/metrics.html) too):


```python
metrics = {
    "rouge": {
        "metric": "rouge",
        "config": {"variety": "rouge_l"},
    },
    "chrf": {
        "metric": "chrf",
        "config": {},
    },
    "bert_score": {
        "metric": "bert_score",
        "config": {"model": "bert-base-uncased"},
    },
    "uni_eval": {
        "metric": "uni_eval",
        "config": {"task": "summarization", "evaluation_aspect": "relevance"},
    },
}
```


```python
critique_data = [
    {"target": pred['result'], "references": [pred['answer']]} for pred in predictions
]
eval_results = {
    k: critique.evaluate(dataset=critique_data, metric=v["metric"], config=v["config"])
    for k, v in metrics.items()
}
```

Finally, we can print out the results. We can see that overall the scores are higher when the output is semantically correct, and also when the output closely matches with the gold-standard answer.


```python
for i, eg in enumerate(examples):
    score_string = ", ".join([f"{k}={v['examples'][i]['value']:.4f}" for k, v in eval_results.items()])
    print(f"Example {i}:")
    print("Question: " + predictions[i]['query'])
    print("Real Answer: " + predictions[i]['answer'])
    print("Predicted Answer: " + predictions[i]['result'])
    print("Predicted Scores: " + score_string)
    print()
```
