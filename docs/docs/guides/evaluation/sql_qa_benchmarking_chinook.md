# SQL Question Answering Benchmarking: Chinook

Here we go over how to benchmark performance on a question answering task over a SQL database.

It is highly reccomended that you do any evaluation/benchmarking with tracing enabled. See [here](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tracing.html) for an explanation of what tracing is and how to set it up.

```python
# Comment this out if you are NOT using tracing
import os
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_HANDLER"] = "langchain"
```

## Loading the data

First, let's load the data.


```python
from langchain.evaluation.loading import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("sql-qa-chinook")
```

```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## Setting up a chain
This uses the example Chinook database.
To set it up follow the instructions on https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/, placing the `.db` file in a notebooks folder at the root of this repository.

Note that here we load a simple chain. If you want to experiment with more complex chains, or an agent, just create the `chain` object in a different way.


```python
from langchain import OpenAI, SQLDatabase, SQLDatabaseChain
```


```python
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///../../../notebooks/Chinook.db")
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
```

Now we can create a SQL database chain.


```python
chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, input_key="question")
```

## Make a prediction

First, we can make predictions one datapoint at a time. Doing it at this level of granularity allows use to explore the outputs in detail, and also is a lot cheaper than running over multiple datapoints


```python
chain(dataset[0])
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'question': 'How many employees are there?',
     'answer': '8',
     'result': ' There are 8 employees.'}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## Make many predictions
Now we can make predictions. Note that we add a try-except because this chain can sometimes error (if SQL is written incorrectly, etc)


```python
predictions = []
predicted_dataset = []
error_dataset = []
for data in dataset:
    try:
        predictions.append(chain(data))
        predicted_dataset.append(data)
    except:
        error_dataset.append(data)
```

## Evaluate performance
Now we can evaluate the predictions. We can use a language model to score them programatically


```python
from langchain.evaluation.qa import QAEvalChain
```


```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
eval_chain = QAEvalChain.from_llm(llm)
graded_outputs = eval_chain.evaluate(predicted_dataset, predictions, question_key="question", prediction_key="result")
```

We can add in the graded output to the `predictions` dict and then get a count of the grades.


```python
for i, prediction in enumerate(predictions):
    prediction['grade'] = graded_outputs[i]['text']
```


```python
from collections import Counter
Counter([pred['grade'] for pred in predictions])
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Counter({' CORRECT': 3, ' INCORRECT': 4})
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

We can also filter the datapoints to the incorrect examples and look at them.


```python
incorrect = [pred for pred in predictions if pred['grade'] == " INCORRECT"]
```


```python
incorrect[0]
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'question': 'How many employees are also customers?',
     'answer': 'None',
     'result': ' 59 employees are also customers.',
     'grade': ' INCORRECT'}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>
