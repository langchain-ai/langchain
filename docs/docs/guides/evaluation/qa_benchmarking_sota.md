# Question Answering Benchmarking: State of the Union Address

Here we go over how to benchmark performance on a question answering task over a state of the union address.

It is highly reccomended that you do any evaluation/benchmarking with tracing enabled. See [here](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tracing.html) for an explanation of what tracing is and how to set it up.

```python
# Comment this out if you are NOT using tracing
import os
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_HANDLER"] = "langchain"
```

## Loading the data
First, let's load the data.


```python
from langchain.evaluation.loading import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("question-answering-state-of-the-union")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Found cached dataset json (/Users/harrisonchase/.cache/huggingface/datasets/LangChainDatasets___json/LangChainDatasets--question-answering-state-of-the-union-a7e5a3b2db4f440d/0.0.0/0f7e3662623656454fcd2b650f34e886a7db4b9104504885bd462096cc7a9f51)



      0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## Setting up a chain
Now we need to create some pipelines for doing question answering. Step one in that is creating an index over the data in question.

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader

loader = TextLoader("../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt")
```


```python
from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator
```


```python
vectorstore = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader]).vectorstore
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Running Chroma using direct local API.
    Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

Now we can create a question answering chain.


```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
```


```python
chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type="stuff", retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(), input_key="question")
```

## Make a prediction

First, we can make predictions one datapoint at a time. Doing it at this level of granularity allows use to explore the outputs in detail, and also is a lot cheaper than running over multiple datapoints


```python
chain(dataset[0])
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'question': 'What is the purpose of the NATO Alliance?',
     'answer': 'The purpose of the NATO Alliance is to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2.',
     'result': ' The NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2.'}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## Make many predictions
Now we can make predictions


```python
predictions = chain.apply(dataset)
```

## Evaluate performance
Now we can evaluate the predictions. The first thing we can do is look at them by eye.


```python
predictions[0]
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'question': 'What is the purpose of the NATO Alliance?',
     'answer': 'The purpose of the NATO Alliance is to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2.',
     'result': ' The purpose of the NATO Alliance is to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2.'}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

Next, we can use a language model to score them programatically


```python
from langchain.evaluation.qa import QAEvalChain
```


```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
eval_chain = QAEvalChain.from_llm(llm)
graded_outputs = eval_chain.evaluate(dataset, predictions, question_key="question", prediction_key="result")
```

We can add in the graded output to the `predictions` dict and then get a count of the grades.


```python
for i, prediction in enumerate(predictions):
    prediction['grade'] = graded_outputs[i]['text']
```


```python
from collections import Counter
Counter([pred['grade'] for pred in predictions])
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Counter({' CORRECT': 7, ' INCORRECT': 4})
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

We can also filter the datapoints to the incorrect examples and look at them.


```python
incorrect = [pred for pred in predictions if pred['grade'] == " INCORRECT"]
```


```python
incorrect[0]
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'question': 'What is the U.S. Department of Justice doing to combat the crimes of Russian oligarchs?',
     'answer': 'The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.',
     'result': ' The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs and is naming a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.',
     'grade': ' INCORRECT'}
```
