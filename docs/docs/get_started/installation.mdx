# Installation

## Official release

To install LangChain run:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pip" label="Pip" default>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">pip install langchain</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="conda" label="Conda">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">conda install langchain -c conda-forge</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will install the bare minimum requirements of LangChain.
A lot of the value of LangChain comes when integrating it with various model providers, datastores, etc.
By default, the dependencies needed to do that are NOT installed. You will need to install the dependencies for specific integrations separately.

## From source

If you want to install from source, you can do so by cloning the repo and be sure that the directory is `PATH/TO/REPO/langchain/libs/langchain` running:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## LangChain core
The `langchain-core` package contains base abstractions that the rest of the LangChain ecosystem uses, along with the LangChain Expression Language. It is automatically installed by `langchain`, but can also be used separately. Install with:

```bash
pip install langchain-core
```

## LangChain community
The `langchain-community` package contains third-party integrations. It is automatically installed by `langchain`, but can also be used separately. Install with:

```bash
pip install langchain-community
```

## LangChain experimental
The `langchain-experimental` package holds experimental LangChain code, intended for research and experimental uses.
Install with:

```bash
pip install langchain-experimental
```

## LangGraph
`langgraph` is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, built on top of (and intended to be used with) LangChain.
Install with:

```bash
pip install langgraph
```
## LangServe
LangServe helps developers deploy LangChain runnables and chains as a REST API.
LangServe is automatically installed by LangChain CLI.
If not using LangChain CLI, install with:

```bash
pip install "langserve[all]"
```
for both client and server dependencies. Or `pip install "langserve[client]"` for client code, and `pip install "langserve[server]"` for server code.

## LangChain CLI
The LangChain CLI is useful for working with LangChain templates and other LangServe projects.
Install with:

```bash
pip install langchain-cli
```

## LangSmith SDK
The LangSmith SDK is automatically installed by LangChain.
If not using LangChain, install with:

```bash
pip install langsmith
```
