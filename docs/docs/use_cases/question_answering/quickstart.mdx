# Quickstart

LangChain has a number of components designed to help build
question-answering applications, and RAG applications more generally. To
familiarize ourselves with these, we’ll build a simple Q&A application
over a text data source. Along the way we’ll go over a typical Q&A
architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight
additional resources for more advanced Q&A techniques. We’ll also see
how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application.
LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in
complexity.

## Architecture

We’ll create a typical RAG application as outlined in the [Q&A
introduction](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/), which has
two main components:

**Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing
it. _This usually happens offline._

**Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user
query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then
passes that to the model.

The full sequence from raw data to answer will look like:

### Indexing

1.  **Load**: First we need to load our data. We’ll use
    [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/)
    for this.
2.  **Split**: [Text
    splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/)
    break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for
    indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks
    are harder to search over and won’t fit in a model’s finite context
    window.
3.  **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that
    they can later be searched over. This is often done using a
    [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/)
    and
    [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/)
    model.

### Retrieval and generation

1.  **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from
    storage using a
    [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/).
2.  **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat/) /
    [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using
    a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data

## Setup

### Dependencies

We’ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store
in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any
[ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat/) or
[LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/),
[Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/), and
[VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) or
[Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/).

We’ll use the following packages:

```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain-community langchainhub langchain-openai chromadb bs4
```

We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` for the embeddings model, which can be done
directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so:

```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()

# import dotenv

# dotenv.load_dotenv()
```

### LangSmith

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple
steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get
more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what
exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this
is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).

Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to
use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set
your environment variables to start logging traces:

```python
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```

## Preview

In this guide we’ll build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous
Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post
by Lilian Weng, which allows us to ask questions about the contents of
the post.

We can create a simple indexing pipeline and RAG chain to do this in ~20
lines of code:

```python
import bs4
from langchain import hub
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
```

import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" />

```python
# Load, chunk and index the contents of the blog.
loader = WebBaseLoader(
    web_paths=("https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/",),
    bs_kwargs=dict(
        parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer(
            class_=("post-content", "post-title", "post-header")
        )
    ),
)
docs = loader.load()

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())

# Retrieve and generate using the relevant snippets of the blog.
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
prompt = hub.pull("rlm/rag-prompt")

def format_docs(docs):
    return "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)


rag_chain = (
    {"context": retriever | format_docs, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)
```

```python
rag_chain.invoke("What is Task Decomposition?")
```

```text
'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs.

```

```python
# cleanup
vectorstore.delete_collection()
```

## Detailed walkthrough

Let’s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what’s
going on.

## 1. Indexing: Load {#indexing-load}

We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use
[DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/)
for this, which are objects that load in data from a source and return a
list of
[Documents](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html).
A `Document` is an object with some `page_content` (str) and `metadata`
(dict).

In this case we’ll use the
[WebBaseLoader](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/web_base),
which uses `urllib` to load HTML from web URLs and `BeautifulSoup` to
parse it to text. We can customize the HTML -\> text parsing by passing
in parameters to the `BeautifulSoup` parser via `bs_kwargs` (see
[BeautifulSoup
docs](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#beautifulsoup)).
In this case only HTML tags with class “post-content”, “post-title”, or
“post-header” are relevant, so we’ll remove all others.

```python
import bs4
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader

# Only keep post title, headers, and content from the full HTML.
bs4_strainer = bs4.SoupStrainer(class_=("post-title", "post-header", "post-content"))
loader = WebBaseLoader(
    web_paths=("https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/",),
    bs_kwargs={"parse_only": bs4_strainer},
)
docs = loader.load()
```

```python
len(docs[0].page_content)
```

```text
42824
```

```python
print(docs[0].page_content[:500])
```

      LLM Powered Autonomous Agents

Date: June 23, 2023  |  Estimated Reading Time: 31 min  |  Author: Lilian Weng


Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.

## 2. Indexing: Split {#indexing-split}

Our loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit
in the context window of many models. Even for those models that could
fit the full post in their context window, models can struggle to find
information in very long inputs.

To handle this we’ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and
vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits
of the blog post at run time.

In this case we’ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters
with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps
mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important
context related to it. We use the
[RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/recursive_text_splitter),
which will recursively split the document using common separators like
new lines until each chunk is the appropriate size. This is the
recommended text splitter for generic text use cases.

We set `add_start_index=True` so that the character index at which each
split Document starts within the initial Document is preserved as
metadata attribute “start_index”.

```python
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True
)
all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
```

```python
len(all_splits)
```

```text
66
```

```python
len(all_splits[0].page_content)
```

```text
969
```

```python
all_splits[10].metadata
```

```text
{'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/',
 'start_index': 7056}
```

`TextSplitter`: Object that splits a list of `Document`s into smaller
chunks. Subclass of `DocumentTransformer`s.

  split in the original `Document`: - [Markdown

## 3. Indexing: Store {#indexing-store}

Now we need to index our 66 text chunks so that we can search over them
at runtime. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of
each document split and insert these embeddings into a vector database
(or vector store). When we want to search over our splits, we take a
text search query, embed it, and perform some sort of “similarity”
search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to
our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine
similarity — we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of
embeddings (which are high dimensional vectors).

We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command
using the [Chroma](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/chroma)
vector store and
[OpenAIEmbeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/openai)
model.

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())
```

### Go deeper

`Embeddings`: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting
text to embeddings.

- [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding): Detailed documentation on how to use embeddings.
- [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/): 30+ integrations to choose from.
- [Interface](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/embeddings/langchain_core.embeddings.Embeddings.html): API reference for the base interface.

`VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and
querying embeddings.

- [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Detailed documentation on how to use vector stores.
- [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/): 40+ integrations to choose from.
- [Interface](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/vectorstores/langchain_core.vectorstores.VectorStore.html): API reference for the base interface.

This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point
we have a query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our
blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return
the snippets of the blog post that answer the question.

## 4. Retrieval and Generation: Retrieve {#retrieval-and-generation-retrieve}

Now let’s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple
application that takes a user question, searches for documents relevant
to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to
a model, and returns an answer.

First we need to define our logic for searching over documents.
LangChain defines a
[Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/) interface
which wraps an index that can return relevant `Documents` given a string
query.

The most common type of `Retriever` is the
[VectorStoreRetriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/vectorstore),
which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to
facilitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a
`Retriever` with `VectorStore.as_retriever()`:

```python
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type="similarity", search_kwargs={"k": 6})
```

```python
retrieved_docs = retriever.invoke("What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?")
```

```python
len(retrieved_docs)
```

```text
6
```

```python
print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content)
```

```text
Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.
Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like "Steps for XYZ.\n1.", "What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. "Write a story outline." for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.
```

### Go deeper

Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are other ways
to do retrieval, too.

`Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query

- [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Further
  documentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques.
  Some of which include:
  - `MultiQueryRetriever` [generates variants of the input
    question](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/MultiQueryRetriever)
    to improve retrieval hit rate.
  - `MultiVectorRetriever` (diagram below) instead generates
    [variants of the
    embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector),
    also in order to improve retrieval hit rate.
  - `Max marginal relevance` selects for [relevance and
    diversity](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jgc/publication/The_Use_MMR_Diversity_Based_LTMIR_1998.pdf)
    among the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate
    context.
  - Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using
    metadata filters, such as with a [Self Query
    Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/self_query).
- [Integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers/): Integrations
  with retrieval services.
- [Interface](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/retrievers/langchain_core.retrievers.BaseRetriever.html):
  API reference for the base interface.

## 5. Retrieval and Generation: Generate {#retrieval-and-generation-generate}

Let’s put it all together into a chain that takes a question, retrieves
relevant documents, constructs a prompt, passes that to a model, and
parses the output.

We’ll use the gpt-3.5-turbo OpenAI chat model, but any LangChain `LLM`
or `ChatModel` could be substituted in.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<ChatModelTabs
  customVarName="llm"
  anthropicParams={`"model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229", temperature=0.2, max_tokens=1024"`}
/>

We’ll use a prompt for RAG that is checked into the LangChain prompt hub
([here](https://smith.langchain.com/hub/rlm/rag-prompt)).

```python
from langchain import hub

prompt = hub.pull("rlm/rag-prompt")
```

```python
example_messages = prompt.invoke(
    {"context": "filler context", "question": "filler question"}
).to_messages()
example_messages
```

```text
[HumanMessage(content="You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\nQuestion: filler question \nContext: filler context \nAnswer:")]
```

```python
print(example_messages[0].content)
```

```text
You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.
Question: filler question
Context: filler context
Answer:
```

We’ll use the [LCEL Runnable](/docs/expression_language/)
protocol to define the chain, allowing us to - pipe together components
and functions in a transparent way - automatically trace our chain in
LangSmith - get streaming, async, and batched calling out of the box

```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough


def format_docs(docs):
    return "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)


rag_chain = (
    {"context": retriever | format_docs, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)
```

```python
for chunk in rag_chain.stream("What is Task Decomposition?"):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
```

```text
Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It involves transforming big tasks into multiple manageable tasks, allowing for easier interpretation and execution by autonomous agents or models. Task decomposition can be done through various methods, such as using prompting techniques, task-specific instructions, or human inputs.

#### Choosing a model

`ChatModel`: An LLM-backed chat model. Takes in a sequence of messages
and returns a message.

See a guide on RAG with locally-running models
[here](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/local_retrieval_qa).

#### Customizing the prompt

As shown above, we can load prompts (e.g., [this RAG
prompt](https://smith.langchain.com/hub/rlm/rag-prompt)) from the prompt
hub. The prompt can also be easily customized:

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

template = """Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.
Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer as concise as possible.
Always say "thanks for asking!" at the end of the answer.

{context}

Question: {question}

Helpful Answer:"""
custom_rag_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)

rag_chain = (
    {"context": retriever | format_docs, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | custom_rag_prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)

rag_chain.invoke("What is Task Decomposition?")
```

```text
'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It involves transforming big tasks into multiple manageable tasks, allowing for a more systematic and organized approach to problem-solving. Thanks for asking!'
```
