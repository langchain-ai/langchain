    "In many Q&A applications we want to allow the user to have a back-and-forth conversation, meaning the application needs some sort of \"memory\" of past questions and answers, and some logic for incorporating those into its current thinking.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt**: Update our prompt to support historical messages as an input.\n",
    "2. **Contextualizing questions**: Add a sub-chain that takes the latest user question and reformulates it in the context of the chat history. This is needed in case the latest question references some context from past messages. For example, if a user asks a follow-up question like \"Can you elaborate on the second point?\", this cannot be understood without the context of the previous message. Therefore we can't effectively perform retrieval with a question like this."

Using Chain of Thought (CoT): CoT is a prompting technique that instructs the model to \"think step by step\" and decompose complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. This approach utilizes more computation at test-time and sheds light on the model\\'s thinking process.\\n\\n2. Prompting with LLM: Language Model (LLM) can be used to prompt the model with simple instructions like \"Steps for XYZ\" or \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\" This method guides the model to break down the task into manageable steps.\\n\\n3. Task-specific instructions: For certain tasks, task-specific instructions can be provided to guide the model in decomposing the task. For example, for writing a novel, the instruction \"Write a story outline\" can be given to help the model break down the task into smaller components.\\n\\n4. Human inputs: In some cases, human inputs can be used to assist in task decomposition. Humans can provide insights, expertise, and domain knowledge to help break down complex tasks into smaller subtasks.\\n\\nThese approaches aim to simplify complex tasks and enable more effective problem-solving and planning.')"
