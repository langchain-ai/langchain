    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/docs/docs/use_cases/graph/diffbot_graphtransformer.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use case\n",
    "\n",
    "Text data often contain rich relationships and insights that can be useful for various analytics, recommendation engines, or knowledge management applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffbot's NLP API allows for the extraction of entities, relationships, and semantic meaning from unstructured text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By coupling Diffbot's NLP API with Neo4j, a graph database, you can create powerful, dynamic graph structures based on the information extracted from text. These graph structures are fully queryable and can be integrated into various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination allows for use cases such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Building knowledge graphs from textual documents, websites, or social media feeds.\n",
    "* Generating recommendations based on semantic relationships in the data.\n",
    "* Creating advanced search features that understand the relationships between entities.\n",
    "* Building analytics dashboards that allow users to explore the hidden relationships in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides tools to interact with Graph Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Construct knowledge graphs from text` using graph transformer and store integrations \n",
    "2. `Query a graph database` using chains for query creation and execution\n",
    "3. `Interact with a graph database` using agents for robust and flexible querying \n",
    "\n",
    "## Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "First, get required packages and set environment variables:"
