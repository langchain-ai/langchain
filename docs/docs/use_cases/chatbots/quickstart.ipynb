    "\n",
    "We'll go over an example of how to design and implement an LLM-powered chatbot. Here are a few of the high-level components we'll be working with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Chat Models`. The chatbot interface is based around messages rather than raw text, and therefore is best suited to Chat Models rather than text LLMs. See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface.\n",
    "- `Prompt Templates`, which simplify the process of assembling prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context.\n",
    "- `Chat History`, which allows a chatbot to \"remember\" past interactions and take them into account when responding to followup questions. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/chat_messages/) for more information.\n",
    "- `Retrievers` (optional), which are useful if you want to build a chatbot that can use domain-specific, up-to-date knowledge as context to augment its responses. [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems.\n",
