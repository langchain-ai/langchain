      "1. **Building a Multi-Modal Model with LangChain**:\n",
      "   - Start by defining your multi-modal model using LangChain. LangChain provides integrations with various deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers, making it easy to incorporate different modalities such as text, images, and audio.\n",
      "   - You can create separate components for each modality and then combine them in a chain to build a multi-modal model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Building a Stateful, Multi-Actor Application with LangGraph**:\n",
      "   - Once you have your multi-modal model defined in LangChain, you can use LangGraph to build a stateful, multi-actor application around it.\n",
      "   - LangGraph allows you to define actors that interact with each other and maintain state, which is useful for handling multi-modal inputs and outputs in a chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Deploying the Chain as a REST API with LangServe**:\n",
      "   - After building your multi-modal model and application using LangChain and LangGraph, you can deploy the chain as a REST API using LangServe.\n",
      "   - LangServe simplifies the process of exposing your LangChain application as a REST API, allowing you to easily interact with your multi-modal model through HTTP requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Testing and Tracing with LangSmith**:\n",
      "   - To ensure the reliability and performance of your multi-modal model and REST API, you can use LangSmith for testing and tracing.\n",
      "   - LangSmith provides tools for tracing the execution of your LLM applications and running tests to validate their functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps and leveraging the capabilities of LangChain, LangGraph, LangServe, and LangSmith, you can effectively use multi-modal models in a chain and turn the chain into a REST API.\n"
