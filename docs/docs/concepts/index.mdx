# Conceptual Guide

## Overview

In this guide, you'll find explanations of the key concepts, providing a deeper understanding of core principles.

We recommend that you go through at least one of the [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials) before diving into the conceptual guide. This will help you understand the context and practical applications of the concepts discussed here.

The conceptual guide will not cover step-by-step instructions or specific implementation details — those are found in the [How-To Guides](/docs/how_to/) and [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials) sections. For detailed reference material, please visit the [API Reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/).


## High Level

- **[Why LangChain?](/docs/concepts/why_langchain)**: Why LangChain is the best choice for building AI applications.
- **[Architecture](/docs/concepts/architecture)**: Overview of how packages are organized in the LangChain ecosystem.

## Concepts

- **[Chat Models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)**: Modern LLMs exposed via a chat interface which process sequences of messages as input and output a message.
- **[Messages](/docs/concepts/messages)**: Messages are the unit of communication in modern LLMs, used to represent input and output of a chat model, as well as any additional context or metadata that may be associated with the conversation.
- **[Chat History](/docs/concepts/chat_history)**: Chat history is a record of the conversation between the user and the chat model, used to maintain context and state throughout the conversation.
- **[Tools](/docs/concepts/tools)**: The **tool** abstraction in LangChain associates a Python **function** with a **schema** defining the function's **name**, **description**, and **input**.
- **[Tool Calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling)**: Tool calling is the process of invoking a tool from a chat model.
- **[Structured Output](/docs/concepts/structured_outputs)**: A technique to make the chat model respond in a structured format, such as JSON and matching a specific schema.
- **[Memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/)**: Explanation of **short-term memory** and **long-term memory** and how to implement them using LangGraph.
- **[Multimodality](/docs/concepts/multimodality)**: The ability to work with data that comes in different forms, such as text, audio, images, and video.
- **[Tokens](/docs/concepts/tokens)**: Modern large language models (LLMs) are typically based on a transformer architecture that processes a sequence of units known as tokens.
- **[Runnable Interface](/docs/concepts/runnables)**: Description of the standard Runnable interface which is implemented by many components in LangChain.
- **[LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/lcel)**: A declarative approach to building new Runnables from existing Runnables.
- **[Document Loaders](/docs/concepts/document_loaders)**: Abstraction for loading documents.
- **[Retrieval](/docs/concepts/retrieval)**: Information retrieval systems can retrieve structured or unstructured data from a datasource in response to a query.
- **[Text Splitters](/docs/concepts/text_splitters)**: Use to split long content into smaller more manageable chunks.
- **[Embedding Models](/docs/concepts/embedding_models)**: Embedding models are models that can represent data in a vector space.
- **[VectorStores](/docs/concepts/vectorstores)**: A datastore that can store embeddings and associated data and supports efficient vector search.
- **[Retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers)**: A retriever is a component that retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base in response to a query.
- **[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](/docs/concepts/rag)**: A powerful technique that enhances language models by combining them with external knowledge bases.
- **[Agents](/docs/concepts/agents)**: Use a [language model](/docs/concepts/chat_models) to choose a sequence of actions to take. Agents can interact with external resources via [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling).
- **[Prompt Templates](/docs/concepts/prompt_templates)**: Use to define prompt **templates** that can be lazily evaluated to generate prompts for [language models](/docs/concepts/chat_models). Primarily used with [LCEL](/docs/concepts/lcel) or prompts need to be serialized and stored for later use (e.g., in a database).
- **[Async Programming with LangChain](/docs/concepts/async)**: This guide covers some basic things that one should know to work with LangChain in an asynchronous context.
- **[Callbacks](/docs/concepts/callbacks)**: Learn about the callback system in LangChain. It is composed of CallbackManagers (which dispatch events to the registered handlers) and CallbackHandlers (which handle the events). Callbacks are used to stream outputs from LLMs in LangChain, observe the progress of an LLM application, and more.
- **[Output Parsers](/docs/concepts/output_parsers)**: Output parsers are responsible for taking the output of a model and transforming it into a more suitable format for downstream tasks. Output parsers were primarily useful prior to the general availability of [chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models) that natively support [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling) and [structured outputs](/docs/concepts/structured_outputs).
- **[Few shot prompting](/docs/concepts/few_shot_prompting)**: Few-shot prompting is a technique used improve the performance of language models by providing them with a few examples of the task they are expected to perform.
- **[Example Selectors](/docs/concepts/example_selectors)**: Example selectors are used to select examples from a dataset based on a given input. They can be used to select examples randomly, by semantic similarity, or based on some other constraints. Example selectors are used in few-shot prompting to select examples for a prompt.
