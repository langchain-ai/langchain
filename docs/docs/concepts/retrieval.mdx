## Overview 

![Retrieval](/img/retrieval_high_level.png)

Retrieval systems are fundamental to many AI applications, efficiently identifying relevant information from large datasets. These systems bridge the gap between natural language queries and various data storage formats:

- For unstructured data (e.g., documents, articles), vector stores and lexical search indexes are common.
- For structured data, specialized query languages (DSLs) access information in relational or graph databases.

Query analysis is crucial in this retrieval process, using models to translate natural language queries into formats compatible with the underlying search index or database.

## Key concepts 

![Retrieval](/img/retrieval_concept.png)

(1) **Search index**: An efficient data structure that enables quick retrieval of information based on a query.

(2) **Query analysis**: A process where models transform or construct search queries to optimize retrieval.

## Search Index 

### Unstructured data 

For retrieving unstructured data, LangChain uses the `retriever` interface: given a query as a string, it returns a list of the most relevant documents. 
`Retrievers` can use many different types of indexes, including vector indexes and / or lexical search indexes.
The central point is that a retriever offers a uniform way to retrieve unstructured data and as standardized `Document` objects, regardless of the underlying implementation. 
This abstraction allows for easy swapping and experimentation with different retrieval methods.
Here's a basic example of using a retriever with a query:

```python
docs = retriever.invoke(query)
```

See our conceptual guide on [retrievers](/docs/concepts/retrievers/) for more details.

### Structured data 

For indexing structured data, many kinds of relational or graph databases can be used.
In relational databases, for example, indexes are typically created on specific columns to speed up query performance. 
They work like a book's table of contents, allowing the database to quickly locate the data without scanning the entire table.
As an example, this creates an index on the `last_name` column of the `employees` table, which can dramatically speed up queries that filter or sort by last name.

```SQL
CREATE INDEX idx_last_name ON employees(last_name);
```

In graph databases, indexing often focuses on node properties or relationship types to speed up traversal and pattern matching queries.
When working with structured data, the choice of index type and the columns to index significantly impacts query performance. 
To learn more, see our integration guide and tutorial on working with various [Graph databases](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/graphs/) and [SQL databases](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa/), respectively.

## Query Analysis 

While users typically prefer to interact with retrieval systems using natural language, search indexes often require specific query syntax or benefit from particular keywords. 
Query analysis serves as a crucial bridge between raw user input and optimized search queries. Here's why it's important:

1. **Syntax Translation**: Search indexes may require structured queries (e.g., SQL for databases).
2. **Keyword Optimization**: Certain keywords can significantly improve results in semantic or lexical searches.
3. **Query Expansion**: Complex user queries might benefit from being broken down or expanded into multiple related queries.

Query analysis employs models to transform or construct optimized search queries from raw user input. 

### Unstructured data

Retrieval systems for unstructured data should ideally handle a wide spectrum of user inputs, from simple and poorly worded queries to complex, multi-faceted questions. 
To achieve this versatility, a popular approach is to use models to transform raw user queries into more effective search queries. 
This transformation can range from simple keyword extraction to sophisticated query expansion and reformulation.
Here are some key benefits of using models for query analysis in unstructured data retrieval:

1. **Query Clarification**: LLMs can rephrase ambiguous or poorly worded queries for clarity.
2. **Semantic Understanding**: They can capture the intent behind a query, going beyond literal keyword matching.
3. **Query Expansion**: LLMs can generate related terms or concepts to broaden the search scope.
4. **Complex Query Handling**: They can break down multi-part questions into simpler sub-queries.

Various techniques have been developed to leverage LLMs for query analysis in unstructured data retrieval. Some popular approaches include:

| Name          | When to use | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Multi-query](/docs/how_to/MultiQueryRetriever/)   | When you need to cover multiple perspectives of a question. | Rewrite the user question from multiple perspectives, retrieve documents for each rewritten question, return the unique documents for all queries. |
| [Decomposition](https://github.com/langchain-ai/rag-from-scratch/blob/main/rag_from_scratch_5_to_9.ipynb) | When a question can be broken down into smaller subproblems. | Decompose a question into a set of subproblems / questions, which can either be solved sequentially (use the answer from first + retrieval to answer the second) or in parallel (consolidate each answer into final answer).                                                           |
| [Step-back](https://github.com/langchain-ai/rag-from-scratch/blob/main/rag_from_scratch_5_to_9.ipynb)     | When a higher-level conceptual understanding is required. | First prompt the LLM to ask a generic step-back question about higher-level concepts or principles, and retrieve relevant facts about them. Use this grounding to help answer the user question. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06117).                                            |
| [HyDE](https://github.com/langchain-ai/rag-from-scratch/blob/main/rag_from_scratch_5_to_9.ipynb)          | If you have challenges retrieving relevant documents using the raw user inputs. | Use an LLM to convert questions into hypothetical documents that answer the question. Use the embedded hypothetical documents to retrieve real documents with the premise that doc-doc similarity search can produce more relevant matches. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496). |

As an example, decomposition can simply be accomplished using prompting and a structured output that enforces a list of sub-questions.
These can then be run sequentially or in parallel on a downstream retriever.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage, HumanMessage

# Define a Pydantic model to enforce the output structure
class Questions(BaseModel):
    questions: List[str] = Field(
        description="A list of sub-questions related to the input query."
    )

# Create an instance of the model and enforce the output structure
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0) 
structured_model = model.with_structured_output(Questions)

# Define the system prompt
system = """You are a helpful assistant that generates multiple sub-questions related to an input question. \n
The goal is to break down the input into a set of sub-problems / sub-questions that can be answers in isolation. \n"""

# Pass the question to the model
question = """What are the main components of an LLM-powered autonomous agent system?"""
questions = structured_model.invoke([SystemMessage(content=system)]+[HumanMessage(content=question)])
```

### Semi-structured and structred data

When dealing with structured or semi-structured data, query analysis often involves translating natural language queries into specialized query languages or filters. 
This translation is crucial for effectively interacting with various types of databases and retrieval systems.

1. **Structured Data**: For relational and graph databases, Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) are used to query data.
   - **Text-to-SQL**: Converts natural language to SQL for relational databases.
   - **Text-to-Cypher**: Transforms user queries into Cypher for graph databases.

2. **Semi-structured Data**: For vectorstores, queries can combine semantic search with metadata filtering.
   - **Natural Language to Metadata Filters**: Converts user queries into appropriate metadata constraints.

These approaches leverage models to bridge the gap between user intent and the specific query requirements of different data storage systems. Here are some popular techniques:

| Name                                        | When to Use                                                                                                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Self Query](/docs/how_to/self_query/)      | If users are asking questions that are better answered by fetching documents based on metadata rather than similarity with the text.          | This uses an LLM to transform user input into two things: (1) a string to look up semantically, (2) a metadata filter to go along with it. This is useful because oftentimes questions are about the METADATA of documents (not the content itself).                                              |
| [Text to SQL](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa/)      | If users are asking questions that require information housed in a relational database, accessible via SQL.                                   | This uses an LLM to transform user input into a SQL query.                                             |
| [Text-to-Cypher](/docs/tutorials/graph/)    | If users are asking questions that require information housed in a graph database, accessible via Cypher.                                     | This uses an LLM to transform user input into a Cypher query.                                              |

As an example, here is how to use the `SelfQueryRetriever` to convert natural language queries into metadata filters.  

```python
metadata_field_info = schema_for_metadata 
document_content_description = "Brief summary of a movie"
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm,
    vectorstore,
    document_content_description,
    metadata_field_info,
)
```
