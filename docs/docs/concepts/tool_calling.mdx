# Tool Calling

## Overview 

Many AI applications interact directly with humans. In these cases, it is appropriate for models to respond in natural language. 
But what about cases where we want a model to also interact *directly* with systems, such as databases or an API?
These systems often have a particular input schema; for example, APIs frequently have a required payload structure.
This need motivates the concept of *tool calling*. You can use [tool calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling/example-use-cases) to request model responses that match a particular schema.

You will sometimes hear the term `function calling`. We use this term interchangeably with `tool calling`.

## Key Concepts 

**(1) Tool Creation:** The tool needs to be described to the model so that the model knows what arguments to provide when it decides to call the tool.
TODO: @eyurtsev to elaborate. **(2) Tool Binding:** The tool needs to be connected to a model that supports tool calling. 
This gives the model awarenes of the tool and the associated input schema required by the tool.
**(3) Tool Calling:** When appropriate, the model can decide to call a tool and ensure its response conforms to the tool's input schema.
**(4) Tool Execution:** The tool can be executed using the arguments provided by the model.

## Recommended usage

This psuedo-code illustrates the recommended workflow for using tool calling. 
Created tools are passed to `.bind_tools()` method as a list.
This model can be called, as usual. If a tool call is made, model's response will contain the tool call arguments.
The tool call arguemtns can be passed directly to the tool.

```python
# Tool creation
tools = [my_tool]
# Tool binding
modelwtools = model.bind_tools(tools)
# Tool calling 
response = modelwtools.invoke(user_input)
# Tool execution
tool_output = my_tool(response.tool_calls)
```

## Tool Creation 

TODO: @eyurtsev to add links and summary of the conceptual guide. 

## Tool Binding 

[Many](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) [model providers](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) support tool calling. 

:::tip
See our [model integration page](/docs/integrations/chat/) for a list of providers that support tool calling.
:::

The central concept to understand is that LangChain provides a standardized interface for connecting tools to models. 
The `.bind_tools()` method can be used to specify which tools are available for a model to call. 

```python
model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([tools_list])
```

As a specific example, let's take a function `multiply` and bind it as a tool to a model that supports tool calling.

```python
def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Multiply a and b.

    Args:
        a: first int
        b: second int
    """
    return a * b

llm_with_tools = tool_calling_model.bind_tools([multiply])
```

## Tool Calling

![Diagram of a tool call by a model](/img/tool_call_example.png)

A key principle of tool calling is that the model decides when to use a tool based on the input's relevance. The model doesn't always need to call a tool.
For example, given an unrelated input, the model would not call the tool:

```python
result = llm_with_tools.invoke("Hello world!")
```

The result would be an `AIMessage` containing the model's response in natural language (e.g., "Hello!").
However, if we pass an input *relevant to the tool*, the model should choose to call it:

```python
result = llm_with_tools.invoke("What is 2 multiplied by 3?")
```

As before, the output `result` will be an `AIMessage`. 
But, if the tool was called, `result` will have a `tool_calls` attribute.
This attribute includes everything needed to execute the tool, including the tool name and input arguments:

```
result.tool_calls
{'name': 'multiply', 'args': {'a': 2, 'b': 3}, 'id': 'xxx', 'type': 'tool_call'}
```

For more details on usage, see our [how-to guides](/docs/how_to/#tools)!

## Tool execution

TODO: @eyurtsev @vbarda let's discuss this. This should also link to tool execution in LangGraph. 

## Best practices

When designing tools to be used by a model, it is important to keep in mind that:

* Models that have explicit [tool-calling APIs](/docs/concepts/#functiontool-calling) will be better at tool calling than non-fine-tuned models.
* Models will perform better if the tools have well-chosen names and descriptions.
* Simple, narrowly scoped tools are easier for models to use than complex tools.
* Asking the model to select from a large list of tools poses challenges for the model.
