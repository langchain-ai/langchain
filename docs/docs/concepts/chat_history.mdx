Chat history is a record of the conversation between the user and the chat model. It is used to maintain context and state throughout the conversation. The chat history is sequence of [messages](/docs/concepts/messages), each of which is associated with a specific [role](/docs/concepts/messages#role), such as "user", "assistant", "system", or "tool".

## Conversation patterns

![Conversation patterns](/img/conversation_patterns.png)

Most conversations start with a **system message** that sets the context for the conversation. This is followed by a **user message** containing the user's input, and then an **assistant message** containing the model's response.

The **assistant** may respond directly to the user or if configured with tools request that a [tool](/docs/concepts/tool_calling) be invoked to perform a specific task.

A full conversation often involves a combination of two patterns of alternating messages:

1. The **user** and the **assistant** representing a back-and-forth conversation.
2. The **assistant** and **tool messages** representing an ["agentic" workflow](/docs/concepts/agents) where the assistant is invoking tools to perform specific tasks.

## Managing chat history

Since chat models have a maximum limit on input size, it's important to manage chat history and trim it as needed to avoid exceeding the [context window](/docs/concepts/chat_models/#context-window).

While processing chat history, it's essential to preserve a correct conversation structure.

Key guidelines for managing chat history:

- The conversation should follow one of these structures:
    - The first message is either a "user" message or a "system" message, followed by a "user" and then an "assistant" message.
    - The last message should be either a "user" message or a "tool" message containing the result of a tool call.
- When using [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling), a "tool" message should only follow an "assistant" message that requested the tool invocation.
