#Agents
By themselves, language models can't take actions â€” they just output text. Agents are systems that take a high-level task and use an LLM as a reasoning engine to decide what actions to take and execute those actions.

LangGraph is an extension of LangChain specifically aimed at creating highly controllable and customizable agents. We recommend using LangGraph for building agents.

Please see the following resources for more information:

*LangGraph docs on common agent architectures
*Pre-built agents in LangGraph

##Legacy Agent Concept: AgentExecutor
LangChain previously introduced the AgentExecutor as a runtime for agents.
While it served as an excellent starting point, its limitations became apparent when dealing with more sophisticated and customized agents.
As a result, we're gradually phasing out AgentExecutor in favor of more flexible solutions in LangGraph.

Transitioning from AgentExecutor to LangGraph
If you're currently using AgentExecutor, don't worry! We've prepared resources to help you:

1. For those who still need to use AgentExecutor, we offer a comprehensive guide on how to use AgentExecutor.

2. However, we strongly recommend transitioning to LangGraph for improved flexibility and control. To facilitate this transition, we've created a detailed migration guide to help you move from AgentExecutor to LangGraph seamlessly.
