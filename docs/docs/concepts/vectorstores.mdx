## Overview

Vector stores are a powerful and efficient way to index and retrieve unstructured data, particularly in the context of AI applications. 
They leverage vector embeddings, which are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning, to enable fast and accurate similarity searches.
At their core, vector stores utilize specialized data structures called vector indices. These indices are designed to perform efficient similarity searches over high-dimensional embedding vectors, allowing for rapid retrieval of relevant information based on semantic similarity rather than exact keyword matches.

LangChain provides a universal interface for working with various vector store implementations, offering a consistent set of methods for common operations such as:

- Adding documents to the store
- Removing documents from the store
- Performing similarity searches
- Updating existing documents

This abstraction allows developers to easily switch between different vector store backends or experiment with various implementations without changing their application code.
As an example, adding documents to a vector store and performing a similarity search looks like this regardless of the underlying vector store implementation:

```python
# Given a list of documents and a vector store
vector_store.add_documents(documents=documents)

# Given a query, search over the documents
docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query)
```

## Key concepts

![Vectorstores](/img/vectorstores.png)
 
 (1) **Generate retrieval units**: Unstructured data is often transformed into smaller pieces of text for embedding and retrieval.

 (2) **Create an easily searchable representation for retrieval units**: Embeddings are used to make the text searchable.

 (3) **Index them for efficient search retrieval**: Embeddings are stored in a vector store for efficient search retrieval.

## Retrieval Units

### Text splitting

Unstructured data sources that we want to store many contain data in a variety of different formats (e.g., pdf, markdown, and more) and lengths.
Text splitting is often a crucial preprocessing step in retrieval systems.
It involves breaking down large texts into smaller, manageable chunks. 
This has benefits, including ensuring consistent processing of varying document lengths, overcoming input size limitations of models, and improving quality of the embedded text representations.
See our conceptual guide on [text splitters](/docs/concepts/text_splitters/) for a detailed overview on this.

### Model-generated representations

In addition to text splitting, it is also possible to use a model to *generate* representations for embedding and retrieval.
For example, you can you a model to summarize the text in a document.
This may be particularly useful if the text is either too long to embed directly or if the text is excessively verbose and contains information that is not relevant to the likely search queries.
The [Multi-Vector](/docs/how_to/multi_vector/) retriever allows the user to use any document transformation (e.g., use a model to write a summary) and index the transformed text in a vectorstore while retaining linkage to the original document.

## Make them searchable 

Whatever transformation is done, the resulting retrieval units are still just pieces of text. We need to transform them into a format that allows for search over this text. 
[Embedding models](/docs/concepts/embedding_models/) are a useful way to do this.
See our [full conceptual overview](/docs/concepts/embedding_models/) for more details, but - in short - embeddings take each retrieval unit and turn into a fixed-length array of floating point numbers.
This array is basically [a set of coordinates in a weird multi-dimensional space](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/23/embeddings/).
This array captures the semantic meaning of the text, and - as a result - text with similar meanings will have similar embeddings in this space.
As a result, simple distance metrics like cosine similarity can be used to identify similar text based on their sematic meaning.

## Indexing

Vectorstores house the embedded documents, providing an interface for storing and retrieving them.
If we pass in a query, the vectorstore will return the most similar embedded documents.
Specifically, the vectorstore will embed the query and perform a similarity search over the embedded retrieval units and return the most similar ones.

### Similarity metrics

A critical advange of embeddings vectors is they can be compared using many mathematical operations:

- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors.
- **Euclidean Distance**: Measures the straight-line distance between two points.
- **Dot Product**: Measures the projection of one vector onto another.

### Indexing algorithms

Given a similarity metric to measure the distance between embedded query and retrieval units, we need an algorithm to efficiently find nearest neighbors in high-dimensional spaces.
Many vectorstores implement [HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/hnsw/), a graph-based index structure that allows for efficient similarity search.

All LangChain vectorstores expose `from_documents` and `from_texts` methods, which will index a list of LangChain `Document` objects or strings into a vectorstore.
Specifically, indexing will use the provided embedding model to create an embedding of each retrieval document, which will then be stored in the vectorstore and made searchable with whatever algorithm the vectorstore implements.

```python
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
db = Chroma.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())
```

See this [how-to guide](/docs/how_to/vectorstores/) for more details on how to add documents to a vector store.

### Search and retreival techniques

All LangChain vectorstores expose a `similarity_search` method. This will take the income search query, create an embedding, and then find all documents with the most similar embedding.
See the [how-to guide](/docs/how_to/vectorstores/) for more details on how to use the `similarity_search` method.

```python
query = "my query"
docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(query)
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

While indexing algorithms like HNSW provide the foundation for efficient similarity search in many cases, additional techniques can be employed to improve search quality and diversity.
For example, [maximal marginal relevance](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/example_selectors/mmr/) is a re-ranking algorithm used to diversify search results, which is applied after the initial similarity search to ensure a more diverse set of results.
As a second example, some [vector stores](/docs/integrations/retrievers/pinecone_hybrid_search/) offer built-in [hybrid-search](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/data/understanding-hybrid-search) to combine keyword and semantic similarity search, which marries the benefits of both approaches. 
At the moment, there is no unified way to perform hybrid search using LangChain vectorstores, but it is generally exposed as a keyword argument that is passed in with `similarity_search`.
See this [how-to guide](/docs/how_to/hybrid/) for more details.

### Metadata 

Most vector stores can also store metadata about embedded vectors and support filtering on that metadata before
similarity search, allowing you more control over returned documents. This allows for querying in two different ways:

1. **Semantic search**: Query the unstructured data directly, often using via embedding or keyword similarity.
2. **Metadata search**: Apply structured query to the metadata, filering specific documents.

Vectorstore support for metadata is highly dependent on the underlying vector store implementation.
Many vectorstores support LangChain [Self Query](/docs/how_to/self_query/) retriever interface to perform metadata search using natural language.
