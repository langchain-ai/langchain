    "# Build an Agent with AgentExecutor (Legacy)\n",
    "\n",
    ":::important\n",
    "This section will cover building with the legacy LangChain AgentExecutor. These are fine for getting started, but past a certain point, you will likely want flexibility and control that they do not offer. For working with more advanced agents, we'd recommend checking out [LangGraph Agents](/docs/concepts/architecture/#langgraph) or the [migration guide](/docs/how_to/migrate_agent/)\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "By themselves, language models can't take actions - they just output text.\n",
    "A big use case for LangChain is creating **[agents](/docs/concepts/agents/)**.\n",
    "Agents are systems that use an LLM as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and what the inputs to those actions should be.\n",
    "The results of those actions can then be fed back into the agent and it determines whether more actions are needed, or whether it is okay to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will build an agent that can interact with multiple different tools: one being a local database, the other being a search engine. You will be able to ask this agent questions, watch it call tools, and have conversations with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Concepts we will cover are:\n",
    "- Using [language models](/docs/concepts/chat_models), in particular their tool calling ability\n",
    "- Creating a [Retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers) to expose specific information to our agent\n",
    "- Using a Search [Tool](/docs/concepts/tools) to look up things online\n",
    "- [`Chat History`](/docs/concepts/chat_history), which allows a chatbot to \"remember\" past interactions and take them into account when responding to follow-up questions. \n",
    "- Debugging and tracing your application using [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide (and most of the other guides in the documentation) uses [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and assumes the reader is as well. Jupyter notebooks are perfect for learning how to work with LLM systems because oftentimes things can go wrong (unexpected output, API down, etc) and going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To install LangChain run:\n",
    "\n",
    "import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\n",
    "import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n",
    "import CodeBlock from \"@theme/CodeBlock\";\n",
    "\n",
    "<Tabs>\n",
    "  <TabItem value=\"pip\" label=\"Pip\" default>\n",
    "    <CodeBlock language=\"bash\">pip install langchain</CodeBlock>\n",
    "  </TabItem>\n",
    "  <TabItem value=\"conda\" label=\"Conda\">\n",
    "    <CodeBlock language=\"bash\">conda install langchain -c conda-forge</CodeBlock>\n",
    "  </TabItem>\n",
    "</Tabs>\n",

    "\n",

    "For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/how_to/installation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangSmith\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
    "As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\n",
    "The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\"true\"\n",
    "export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\"...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if in a notebook, you can set them with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import getpass\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2\"] = \"true\"\n",

It can assist with testing in several ways:\\n\\n1. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: LangSmith allows close monitoring and evaluation of your application. This helps you to ensure the quality of your application and deploy it with confidence.\\n\\n2. **Tracing**: LangSmith has tracing capabilities that can be beneficial for debugging and understanding the behavior of your application.\\n\\n3. **Evaluation Capabilities**: LangSmith has built-in tools for evaluating the performance of your LLM. \\n\\n4. **Prompt Hub**: This is a prompt management tool built into LangSmith that can help in testing different prompts and their responses.\\n\\nPlease note that to use LangSmith, you would need to install it and create an API key. The platform offers Python and Typescript SDKs for utilization. It works independently and does not require the use of LangChain.'}"
