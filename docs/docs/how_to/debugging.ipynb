    "\n",
    "Like building any type of software, at some point you'll need to debug when building with LLMs. A model call will fail, or model output will be misformatted, or there will be some nested model calls and it won't be clear where along the way an incorrect output was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main methods for debugging:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Verbose Mode: This adds print statements for \"important\" events in your chain.\n",
    "- Debug Mode: This add logging statements for ALL events in your chain.\n",
    "- LangSmith Tracing: This logs events to [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) to allow for visualization there.\n",

In 2024 Nolan won an Academy Award for best director for Oppenheimer (2023), which was also named best picture. Nolan’s breakthrough came with the 2000 film Memento, a sleeper hit that he adapted from a short story written by his brother Jonathan Nolan. The film was a critical and popular success and garnered the Nolan brothers an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay. Nolan’s highly anticipated Batman Begins (2005), starring Christian Bale, focuses on the superhero’s origins and features settings and a tone that are grimmer and more realistic than those of previous Batman films.
