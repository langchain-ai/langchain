    "There are three main methods for debugging:\n",

    "- Verbose Mode: This adds print statements for \"important\" events in your chain.\n",

Philosophy professor David Kyle Johnson wrote that \\\\\\\"Inception became a classic almost as soon as it was projected on silver screens\\\\\\\", praising its exploration of philosophical ideas, including leap of faith and allegory of the cave.[97] The film grossed over $836 million worldwide.[98] Nominated for eight Academy Awards—including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay—it won Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects.[99] Nolan was nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Director, among other accolades.[40]\\\\nAround the release of The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Nolan's third and final Batman film, Joseph Bevan of the British Film Institute wrote a profile on him: \\\\\\\"In the space of just over a decade, Christopher Nolan has shot from promising British indie director to undisputed master of a new brand of intelligent escapism. He further wrote that Nolan's body of work reflect \\\\\\\"a heterogeneity of conditions of products\\\\\\\" extending from low-budget films to lucrative blockbusters, \\\\\\\"a wide range of genres and settings\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"a diversity of styles that trumpet his versatility\\\\\\\".[193]\\\\nDavid Bordwell, a film theorist, wrote that Nolan has been able to blend his \\\\\\\"experimental impulses\\\\\\\" with the demands of mainstream entertainment, describing his oeuvre as \\\\\\\"experiments with cinematic time by means of techniques of subjective viewpoint and crosscutting\\\\\\\".[194] Nolan's use of practical, in-camera effects, miniatures and models, as well as shooting on celluloid film, has been highly influential in early 21st century cinema.[195][196] IndieWire wrote in 2019 that, Nolan \\\\\\\"kept a viable alternate model of big-budget filmmaking alive\\\\\\\", in an era where blockbuster filmmaking has become \\\\\\\"a largely computer-generated art form\\\\\\\".[196] Initially reluctant to make a sequel, he agreed after Warner Bros. repeatedly insisted.[78] Nolan wanted to expand on the noir quality of the first film by broadening the canvas and taking on \\\\\\\"the dynamic of a story of the city, a large crime story ... where you're looking at the police, the justice system, the vigilante, the poor people, the rich people, the criminals\\\\\\\".[79] Continuing to minimalise the use of CGI, Nolan employed high-resolution IMAX cameras, making it the first major motion picture to use this technology.[80][81]\\\"}]\"\n",

This gives us 14 leap years.\\n- Total days from leap years: 14 days.\\n\\nAdding all together:\\n- Total days = 19,345 days (from years) + 14 days (from leap years) + 130 days (from July 30, 2023, to December 7, 2023) = 19,489 days.\\n\\nTherefore, as of December 7, 2023, Christopher Nolan is 19,489 days old.\"\n",
