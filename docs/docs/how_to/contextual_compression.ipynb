    "# How to do retrieval with contextual compression\n",
    "\n",
    "One challenge with [retrieval](/docs/concepts/retrieval/) is that usually you don't know the specific queries your document storage system will face when you ingest data into the system. This means that the information most relevant to a query may be buried in a document with a lot of irrelevant text. Passing that full document through your application can lead to more expensive LLM calls and poorer responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contextual compression is meant to fix this. The idea is simple: instead of immediately returning retrieved documents as-is, you can compress them using the context of the given query, so that only the relevant information is returned. “Compressing” here refers to both compressing the contents of an individual document and filtering out documents wholesale.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Contextual Compression Retriever, you'll need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a base [retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers/)\n",
    "- a Document Compressor\n",
    "\n",
    "The Contextual Compression Retriever passes queries to the base retriever, takes the initial documents and passes them through the Document Compressor. The Document Compressor takes a list of documents and shortens it by reducing the contents of documents or dropping documents altogether.\n",
