    "This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:\n",
    "- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)\n",
    "- [Function/tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling)\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often useful to have a model return output that matches a specific [schema](/docs/concepts/structured_outputs/). One common use-case is extracting data from text to insert into a database or use with some other downstream system. This guide covers a few strategies for getting structured outputs from a model.\n",

    "<span data-heading-keywords=\"with_structured_output\"></span>\n",

    "You can find a [list of models that support this method here](/docs/integrations/chat/).\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the easiest and most reliable way to get structured outputs. `with_structured_output()` is implemented for [models that provide native APIs for structuring outputs](/docs/integrations/chat/), like tool/function calling or JSON mode, and makes use of these capabilities under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method takes a schema as input which specifies the names, types, and descriptions of the desired output attributes. The method returns a model-like Runnable, except that instead of outputting strings or [messages](/docs/concepts/messages/) it outputs objects corresponding to the given schema. The schema can be specified as a TypedDict class, [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) or a Pydantic class. If TypedDict or JSON Schema are used then a dictionary will be returned by the Runnable, and if a Pydantic class is used then a Pydantic object will be returned.\n",
