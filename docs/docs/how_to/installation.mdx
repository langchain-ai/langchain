# How to install LangChain packages

The LangChain ecosystem is split into different packages, which allow you to choose exactly which pieces of
functionality to install.

## Official release

To install the main LangChain package, run:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pip" label="Pip" default>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">pip install langchain</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="conda" label="Conda">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">conda install langchain -c conda-forge</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

While this package acts as a sane starting point to using LangChain,
much of the value of LangChain comes when integrating it with various model providers, datastores, etc.
By default, the dependencies needed to do that are NOT installed. You will need to install the dependencies for specific integrations separately.
We'll show how to do that in the next sections of this guide.

## Ecosystem packages

With the exception of the `langsmith` SDK, all packages in the LangChain ecosystem depend on `langchain-core`, which contains base
classes and abstractions that other packages use. The dependency graph below shows how the difference packages are related.
A directed arrow indicates that the source package depends on the target package:

When installing a package, you do not need to explicitly install that package's explicit dependencies (such as `langchain-core`).
However, you may choose to if you are using a feature only available in a certain version of that dependency.
If you do, you should make sure that the installed or pinned version is compatible with any other integration packages you use.

### From source

If you want to install from source, you can do so by cloning the repo and be sure that the directory is `PATH/TO/REPO/langchain/libs/langchain` running:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### LangChain core
The `langchain-core` package contains base abstractions that the rest of the LangChain ecosystem uses, along with the LangChain Expression Language. It is automatically installed by `langchain`, but can also be used separately. Install with:

```bash
pip install langchain-core
```

### LangChain community
The `langchain-community` package contains third-party integrations. Install with:

```bash
pip install langchain-community
```

### LangChain experimental
The `langchain-experimental` package holds experimental LangChain code, intended for research and experimental uses.
Install with:

```bash
pip install langchain-experimental
```

### LangGraph
`langgraph` is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLM. It integrates smoothly with LangChain, but can be used without it.
Install with:

```bash
pip install langgraph
```

### LangServe
LangServe helps developers deploy LangChain runnables and chains as a REST API.
LangServe is automatically installed by LangChain CLI.
If not using LangChain CLI, install with:

```bash
pip install "langserve[all]"
```
for both client and server dependencies. Or `pip install "langserve[client]"` for client code, and `pip install "langserve[server]"` for server code.

## LangChain CLI
The LangChain CLI is useful for working with LangChain templates and other LangServe projects.
Install with:

```bash
pip install langchain-cli
```

### LangSmith SDK
The LangSmith SDK is automatically installed by LangChain. However, it does not depend on
`langchain-core`, and can be installed and used independently if desired.
If you are not using LangChain, you can install it with:

```bash
pip install langsmith
```
