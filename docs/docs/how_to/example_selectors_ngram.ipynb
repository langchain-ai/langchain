    "# How to select examples by n-gram overlap\n",

    "The `NGramOverlapExampleSelector` selects and orders examples based on which examples are most similar to the input, according to an ngram overlap score. The ngram overlap score is a float between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [selector](/docs/concepts/example_selectors/) allows for a threshold score to be set. Examples with an ngram overlap score less than or equal to the threshold are excluded. The threshold is set to -1.0, by default, so will not exclude any examples, only reorder them. Setting the threshold to 0.0 will exclude examples that have no ngram overlaps with the input.\n"
