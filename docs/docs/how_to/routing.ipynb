Routing can help provide structure and consistency around interactions with models by allowing you to define states and use information related to those states as context to model calls.\n",

    "There are two ways to perform routing:\n",

    "1. Conditionally return runnables from a [`RunnableLambda`](/docs/how_to/functions) (recommended)\n",
    "2. Using a `RunnableBranch` (legacy)\n",

      "A path integral is a powerful mathematical concept in physics, particularly in the field of quantum mechanics. It was developed by the renowned physicist Richard Feynman as an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a path integral, instead of considering a single, definite path that a particle might take from one point to another, as in classical mechanics, the particle is considered to take all possible paths simultaneously. Each path is assigned a complex-valued weight, and the total probability amplitude for the particle to go from one point to another is calculated by summing (integrating) over all possible paths.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key ideas behind the path integral formulation are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Superposition principle: In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in a superposition of multiple states or paths simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Probability amplitude: The probability amplitude for a particle to go from one point to another is calculated by summing the complex-valued weights of all possible paths.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Weighting of paths: Each path is assigned a weight based on the action (the time integral of the Lagrangian) along that path. Paths with lower action have a greater weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Feynman's approach: Feynman developed the path integral formulation as an alternative to the traditional wave function approach in quantum mechanics, providing a more intuitive and conceptual understanding of quantum phenomena.\n",
      "\n",
      "The path integral approach is particularly useful in quantum field theory, where it provides a powerful framework for calculating transition probabilities and understanding the behavior of quantum systems. It has also found applications in various areas of physics, such as condensed matter, statistical mechanics, and even in finance (the path integral approach to option pricing).\n",
      "\n",
      "The mathematical construction of the path integral involves the use of advanced concepts from functional analysis and measure theory, making it a powerful and sophisticated tool in the physicist's arsenal.\n"
