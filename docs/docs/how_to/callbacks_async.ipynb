    "- [Callbacks](/docs/concepts/callbacks)\n",
    "- [Custom callback handlers](/docs/how_to/custom_callbacks)\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are planning to use the async APIs, it is recommended to use and extend [`AsyncCallbackHandler`](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/callbacks/langchain_core.callbacks.base.AsyncCallbackHandler.html) to avoid blocking the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ":::warning\n",
    "If you use a sync `CallbackHandler` while using an async method to run your LLM / Chain / Tool / Agent, it will still work. However, under the hood, it will be called with [`run_in_executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.run_in_executor) which can cause issues if your `CallbackHandler` is not thread-safe.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    ":::danger\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're on `python<=3.10`, you need to remember to propagate `config` or `callbacks` when invoking other `runnable` from within a `RunnableLambda`, `RunnableGenerator` or `@tool`. If you do not do this,\n",
    "the callbacks will not be propagated to the child runnables being invoked.\n",
