    "# Run models locally\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use case\n",
    "\n",
    "The popularity of projects like [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama), [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all), [llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile), and others underscore the demand to run LLMs locally (on your own device).\n",
    "\n",
    "This has at least two important benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Privacy`: Your data is not sent to a third party, and it is not subject to the terms of service of a commercial service\n",
    "2. `Cost`: There is no inference fee, which is important for token-intensive applications (e.g., [long-running simulations](https://twitter.com/RLanceMartin/status/1691097659262820352?s=20), summarization)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Running an LLM locally requires a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Open-source LLM`: An open-source LLM that can be freely modified and shared \n",
    "2. `Inference`: Ability to run this LLM on your device w/ acceptable latency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open-source LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can now gain access to a rapidly growing set of [open-source LLMs](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/the-history-of-open-source-llms-better). \n",
    "\n",
    "These LLMs can be assessed across at least two dimensions (see figure):\n",
    " \n",
    "1. `Base model`: What is the base-model and how was it trained?\n",
    "2. `Fine-tuning approach`: Was the base-model fine-tuned and, if so, what [set of instructions](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/beyond-llama-the-power-of-open-llms#%C2%A7alpaca-an-instruction-following-llama-model) was used?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image description](../../static/img/OSS_LLM_overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative performance of these models can be assessed using several leaderboards, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [LmSys](https://chat.lmsys.org/?arena)\n",
    "2. [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/index.html)\n",
    "3. [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "A few frameworks for this have emerged to support inference of open-source LLMs on various devices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp): C++ implementation of llama inference code with [weight optimization / quantization](https://finbarr.ca/how-is-llama-cpp-possible/)\n",
    "2. [`gpt4all`](https://docs.gpt4all.io/index.html): Optimized C backend for inference\n",
    "3. [`Ollama`](https://ollama.ai/): Bundles model weights and environment into an app that runs on device and serves the LLM\n",
    "4. [`llamafile`](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile): Bundles model weights and everything needed to run the model in a single file, allowing you to run the LLM locally from this file without any additional installation steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, these frameworks will do a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Quantization`: Reduce the memory footprint of the raw model weights\n",
    "2. `Efficient implementation for inference`: Support inference on consumer hardware (e.g., CPU or laptop GPU)\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, see [this excellent post](https://finbarr.ca/how-is-llama-cpp-possible/) on the importance of quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image description](../../static/img/llama-memory-weights.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With less precision, we radically decrease the memory needed to store the LLM in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we can see the importance of GPU memory bandwidth [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OehfHHNSn66BP2h3Bxp2NJTVX97icU0GmCXF6pK23H8/edit#gid=0)!\n",
    "\n",
    "A Mac M2 Max is 5-6x faster than a M1 for inference due to the larger GPU memory bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image description](../../static/img/llama_t_put.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Some providers have [chat model](/docs/concepts/chat_models) wrappers that takes care of formatting your input prompt for the specific local model you're using. However, if you are prompting local models with a [text-in/text-out LLM](/docs/concepts/text_llms) wrapper, you may need to use a prompt tailored for your specific model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can [require the inclusion of special tokens](https://huggingface.co/blog/llama2#how-to-prompt-llama-2). [Here's an example for LLaMA 2](https://smith.langchain.com/hub/rlm/rag-prompt-llama).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "[`Ollama`](https://ollama.ai/) is one way to easily run inference on macOS.\n",
    " \n",
    "The instructions [here](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama?tab=readme-ov-file#ollama) provide details, which we summarize:\n",
    " \n",
    "* [Download and run](https://ollama.ai/download) the app\n",
    "* From command line, fetch a model from this [list of options](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama): e.g., `ollama pull llama3.1:8b`\n",
    "* When the app is running, all models are automatically served on `localhost:11434`\n"

       "\"\\nFirstly, let's imagine the scene where Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon. This happened in 1969. The first man on the moon was Neil Armstrong. We already know that.\\n2nd, let's take a step back. Neil Armstrong didn't have any special powers. He had to land his spacecraft safely on the moon without injuring anyone or causing any damage. If he failed to do this, he would have been killed along with all those people who were on board the spacecraft.\\n3rd, let's imagine that Neil Armstrong successfully landed his spacecraft on the moon and made it back to Earth safely. The next step was for him to be hailed as a hero by his people back home. It took years before Neil Armstrong became an American hero.\\n4th, let's take another step back. Let's imagine that Neil Armstrong wasn't hailed as a hero, and instead, he was just forgotten. This happened in the 1970s. Neil Armstrong wasn't recognized for his remarkable achievement on the moon until after he died.\\n5th, let's take another step back. Let's imagine that Neil Armstrong didn't die in the 1970s and instead, lived to be a hundred years old. This happened in 2036. In the year 2036, Neil Armstrong would have been a centenarian.\\nNow, let's think about the present. Neil Armstrong is still alive. He turned 95 years old on July 20th, 2018. If he were to die now, his achievement of becoming the first human being to set foot on the moon would remain an unforgettable moment in history.\\nI hope this helps you understand the significance and importance of Neil Armstrong's achievement on the moon!\""
