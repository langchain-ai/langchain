    "# How to chain runnables\n",

    ":::info Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:\n",
    "- [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/lcel)\n",
    "- [Prompt templates](/docs/concepts/prompt_templates)\n",
    "- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)\n",
    "- [Output parser](/docs/concepts/output_parsers)\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "One point about [LangChain Expression Language](/docs/concepts/lcel) is that any two runnables can be \"chained\" together into sequences. The output of the previous runnable's `.invoke()` call is passed as input to the next runnable. This can be done using the pipe operator (`|`), or the more explicit `.pipe()` method, which does the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting [`RunnableSequence`](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.base.RunnableSequence.html) is itself a runnable, which means it can be invoked, streamed, or further chained just like any other runnable. Advantages of chaining runnables in this way are efficient streaming (the sequence will stream output as soon as it is available), and debugging and tracing with tools like [LangSmith](/docs/how_to/debugging).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The pipe operator: `|`\n",
    "\n",
    "To show off how this works, let's go through an example. We'll walk through a common pattern in LangChain: using a [prompt template](/docs/how_to#prompt-templates) to format input into a [chat model](/docs/how_to#chat-models), and finally converting the chat message output into a string with an [output parser](/docs/how_to#output-parsers).\n",

It pokes fun at the perceived inadequacies of Windows Vista, which was widely criticized for its performance issues and other problems when it was released.\\n\\nBy attributing the Cylons' failure to locate the humans to their use of Vista, the joke creates an amusing and unexpected connection between a fictional advanced race of robots and a familiar technological annoyance experienced by many people in the real world.\\n\\nOverall, the joke relies on incongruity and relatability to generate humor, but without reproducing any copyrighted material directly.\""
