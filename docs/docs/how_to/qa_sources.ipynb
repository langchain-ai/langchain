    "We'll work off of the Q&A app we built over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post by Lilian Weng in the [RAG tutorial](/docs/tutorials/rag).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the built-in [create_retrieval_chain](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.retrieval.create_retrieval_chain.html), which returns sources by default;\n",
    "2. Using a simple [LCEL](/docs/concepts#langchain-expression-language-lcel) implementation, to show the operating principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also show how to structure sources into the model response, such that a model can report what specific sources it used in generating its answer."
