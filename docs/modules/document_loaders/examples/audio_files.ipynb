And this group of criminals has power, but it has not been able to do anything. It has not been able to even remotely change the reality of Italy. Now, on the contrary, the regime is a democratic regime, etc. But that acculturation, that homologation that fascism has not been able to obtain, the power of today, that is, the power of consumerism, instead, it is able to obtain it perfectly. I can tell you without a doubt that true fascism is precisely this power of consumerism that is destroying Italy. And this thing happened so quickly that we did not realize it. It has happened in the last 5, 6, 7, 10 years. It was a kind of nightmare in which we saw Italy around us destroy, disappear, disappear. Now, perhaps awakening from this nightmare and looking around, we realize that there is nothing more to do.', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'docs\\\\modules\\\\document_loaders\\\\examples\\\\example_data\\\\pasolini.mp3', 'task': 'translate'}, lookup_index=0)]"
