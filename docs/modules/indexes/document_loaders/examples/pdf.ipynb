When p = d + 1 − s the proof relies on the Cayley trick, a trick which associates to X a quasi-smooth hypersurface Y in a projective vector bundle, and the Cayley Proposition (4.3) which gives an isomorphism of some primitive cohomologies (4.2) of X and Y . The Cayley trick, following the philosophy of Mavlyutov in [7], reduces results known for quasi-smooth hypersurfaces to quasi-smooth intersection subvarieties. The idea in this paper goes the other way around, we translate some results for quasi-smooth intersection subvarieties to\\n\\nAcknowledgement.

The toric variety P d Σ is a categorical quotient A d ∖ Z ( Σ ) by the group Hom ( Cl ( Σ ) , C ∗ ) and the group action is induced by the Cl ( Σ ) - grading of S .\\n\\nNow we give a brief introduction to complex orbifolds and we mention the needed theorems for the next section. Namely: de Rham theorem and Dolbeault theorem for complex orbifolds.\\n\\nDeﬁnition 2.4.

Quasi-smooth hypersurfaces or more generally quasi-smooth intersection sub- varieties are quasi-smooth subvarieties (see [2] or [7] for more details).\\n\\nRemark 3.3 .

From the exponential short exact sequence\\n\\nwe have a long exact sequence in cohomology\\n\\nH 1 (O ∗ X ) → H 2 ( X, Z ) → H 2 (O X ) ≃ H 0 , 2 ( X )\\n\\nwhere the last isomorphisms is due to Steenbrink in [9].

For k = 1 and P d Σ as the projective space, we recover the classical ( 1 , 1 ) - Lefschetz theorem.\\n\\nBy the Hard Lefschetz Theorem for projective orbifolds (see [11] for details) we\\n\\nBy the Hard Lefschetz Theorem for projective orbifolds (see [11] for details) we get an isomorphism of cohomologies :\\n\\ngiven by the Lefschetz morphism and since it is a morphism of Hodge structures, we have:\\n\\nH 1 , 1 ( X, Q ) ≃ H dim X − 1 , dim X − 1 ( X, Q )\\n\\nCorollary 3.6. If the dimension of X is 1 , 2 or 3 . The Hodge conjecture holds on X\\n\\nProof. If the dim C X = 1 the result is clear by the Hard Lefschetz theorem for projective orbifolds. The dimension 2 and 3 cases are covered by Theorem 3.5 and the Hard Lefschetz.\\n\\nCayley trick and Cayley proposition\\n\\nThe Cayley trick is a way to associate to a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety a quasi- smooth hypersurface. Let L 1 , . . . , L s be line bundles on P d Σ and let π ∶ P ( E ) → P d Σ be the projective space bundle associated to the vector bundle E = L 1 ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ L s . It is known that P ( E ) is a ( d + s − 1 ) -dimensional simplicial toric variety whose fan depends on the degrees of the line bundles and the fan Σ. Furthermore, if the Cox ring, without considering the grading, of P d Σ is C [ x 1 , . . . , x m ] then the Cox ring of P ( E ) is\\n\\nMoreover for X a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety cut oﬀ by f 1 , . . . , f s with deg ( f i ) = [ L i ] we relate the hypersurface Y cut oﬀ by F = y 1 f 1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + y s f s which turns out to be quasi-smooth. For more details see Section 2 in [7].\\n\\nWe will denote P ( E ) as P d + s − 1 Σ ,X to keep track of its relation with X and P d Σ .\\n\\nThe following is a key remark.\\n\\nRemark 4.1 . There is a morphism ι ∶ X → Y ⊂ P d + s − 1 Σ ,X . Moreover every point z ∶ = ( x, y ) ∈ Y with y ≠ 0 has a preimage. Hence for any subvariety W = V ( I W ) ⊂ X ⊂ P d Σ there exists W ′ ⊂ Y ⊂ P d + s − 1 Σ ,X such that π ( W ′ ) = W , i.e., W ′ = { z = ( x, y ) ∣ x ∈ W } .\\n\\nFor X ⊂ P d Σ a quasi-smooth intersection variety the morphism in cohomology induced by the inclusion i ∗ ∶ H d − s ( P d Σ , C ) → H d − s ( X, C ) is injective by Proposition 1.4 in [7].\\n\\nDeﬁnition 4.2. The primitive cohomology of H d − s prim ( X ) is the quotient H d − s ( X, C )/ i ∗ ( H d − s ( P d Σ , C )) and H d − s prim ( X, Q ) with rational coeﬃcients.\\n\\nH d − s ( P d Σ , C ) and H d − s ( X, C ) have pure Hodge structures, and the morphism i ∗ is com- patible with them, so that H d − s prim ( X ) gets a pure Hodge structure.\\n\\nThe next Proposition is the Cayley proposition.\\n\\nProposition 4.3. [Proposition 2.3 in [3] ] Let X = X 1 ∩⋅ ⋅ ⋅∩ X s be a quasi-smooth intersec- tion subvariety in P d Σ cut oﬀ by homogeneous polynomials f 1 . . . f s . Then for p ≠ d + s − 1 2 , d + s − 3 2\\n\\nRemark 4.5 . The above isomorphisms are also true with rational coeﬃcients since H ● ( X, C ) = H ● ( X, Q ) ⊗ Q C . See the beginning of Section 7.1 in [10] for more details.\\n\\nTheorem 5.1. Let Y = { F = y 1 f 1 + ⋯ + y k f k = 0 } ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X be the quasi-smooth hypersurface associated to the quasi-smooth intersection surface X = X f 1 ∩ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ∩ X f k ⊂ P k + 2 Σ . Then on Y the Hodge conjecture holds.\\n\\nthe Hodge conjecture holds.\\n\\nProof. If H k,k prim ( X, Q ) = 0 we are done. So let us assume H k,k prim ( X, Q ) ≠ 0. By the Cayley proposition H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) ≃ H 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) and by the ( 1 , 1 ) -Lefschetz theorem for projective\\n\\ntoric orbifolds there is a non-zero algebraic basis λ C 1 , . . . , λ C n with rational coeﬃcients of H 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) , that is, there are n ∶ = h 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) algebraic curves C 1 , . . . , C n in X such that under the Poincar´e duality the class in homology [ C i ] goes to λ C i , [ C i ] ↦ λ C i . Recall that the Cox ring of P k + 2 is contained in the Cox ring of P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X without considering the grading. Considering the grading we have that if α ∈ Cl ( P k + 2 Σ ) then ( α, 0 ) ∈ Cl ( P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X ) . So the polynomials deﬁning C i ⊂ P k + 2 Σ can be interpreted in P 2 k + 1 X, Σ but with diﬀerent degree. Moreover, by Remark 4.1 each C i is contained in Y = { F = y 1 f 1 + ⋯ + y k f k = 0 } and\\n\\nfurthermore it has codimension k .\\n\\nClaim: { C i } ni = 1 is a basis of prim ( ) . It is enough to prove that λ C i is diﬀerent from zero in H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) or equivalently that the cohomology classes { λ C i } ni = 1 do not come from the ambient space. By contradiction, let us assume that there exists a j and C ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X such that λ C ∈ H k,k ( P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X , Q ) with i ∗ ( λ C ) = λ C j or in terms of homology there exists a ( k + 2 ) -dimensional algebraic subvariety V ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X such that V ∩ Y = C j so they are equal as a homology class of P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X ,i.e., [ V ∩ Y ] = [ C j ] . It is easy to check that π ( V ) ∩ X = C j as a subvariety of P k + 2 Σ where π ∶ ( x, y ) ↦ x . Hence [ π ( V ) ∩ X ] = [ C j ] which is equivalent to say that λ C j comes from P k + 2 Σ which contradicts the choice of [ C j ] .\\n\\nRemark 5.2 . Into the proof of the previous theorem, the key fact was that on X the Hodge conjecture holds and we translate it to Y by contradiction. So, using an analogous argument we have:\\n\\nargument we have:\\n\\nProposition 5.3. Let Y = { F = y 1 f s +⋯+ y s f s = 0 } ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X be the quasi-smooth hypersurface associated to a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety X = X f 1 ∩ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ∩ X f s ⊂ P d Σ such that d + s = 2 ( k + 1 ) . If the Hodge conjecture holds on X then it holds as well on Y .\\n\\nCorollary 5.4. If the dimension of Y is 2 s − 1 , 2 s or 2 s + 1 then the Hodge conjecture holds on Y .\\n\\nProof.

       "Document(page_content='Recently, various DL models and datasets have been developed for layout analysis\\ntasks. The dhSegment [22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [20] for segmen-\\ntation tasks on historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster\\nR-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used for identifying document elements [38]\\nand detecting tables [30, 26]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29] have also\\nbeen used in table detection [27]. However, these models are usually implemented\\nindividually and there is no uniﬁed framework to load and use such models.\\nThere has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document\\nimage processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M\\nrelevant code pieces 6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\\nor provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\\nOCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\\nsimilar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [21], it is designed for\\nanalyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\\nThe DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF\\ndocuments via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9\\nand Detectron2-PubLayNet10 are individual deep learning models trained on\\nlayout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline. The Document\\nAnalysis and Exploitation (DAE) platform [15] and the DeepDIVA project [2]\\naim to improve the reproducibility of DIA methods (or DL models), yet they\\nare not actively maintained. OCR engines like Tesseract [14], easyOCR11 and\\npaddleOCR12 usually do not come with comprehensive functionalities for other\\nDIA tasks like layout analysis.\\nRecent years have also seen numerous eﬀorts to create libraries for promoting\\nreproducibility and reusability in the ﬁeld of DL.

The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and\\nintuitiveinterfacesforapplyingandcustomizingDLmodelsforlayoutde-\\ntection,characterrecognition,andmanyotherdocumentprocessingtasks.\\nTo promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community\\nplatform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-\\nzation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both\\nlightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.\\nThe library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.\\nKeywords: DocumentImageAnalysis·DeepLearning·LayoutAnalysis\\n· Character Recognition · Open Source library · Toolkit.\\n1 Introduction\\nDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of\\ndocumentimageanalysis(DIA)tasksincludingdocumentimageclassification[11,', metadata={'source': 'example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf', 'file_path': 'example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf', 'page': 1, 'total_pages': 16, 'Author': '', 'CreationDate': 'D:20210622012710Z', 'Creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'Keywords': '', 'ModDate': 'D:20210622012710Z', 'PTEX.Fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.21 (TeX Live 2020) kpathsea version 6.3.2', 'Producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'Subject': '', 'Title': '', 'Trapped': 'False'})"
