    "# Streaming with LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides streaming support for LLMs. Currently, we only support streaming for the `OpenAI` and `ChatOpenAI` LLM implementation, but streaming support for other LLM implementations is on the roadmap. To utilize streaming, use a [`CallbackHandler`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/callbacks/base.py) that implements `on_llm_new_token`. In this example, we are using [`StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler`]()."
