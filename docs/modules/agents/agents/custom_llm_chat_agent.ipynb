    "# Custom LLM Agent (with a ChatModel)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook goes through how to create your own custom agent based on a chat model.\n",
    "\n",
    "An LLM chat agent consists of three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- PromptTemplate: This is the prompt template that can be used to instruct the language model on what to do\n",
    "- ChatModel: This is the language model that powers the agent\n",
    "- `stop` sequence: Instructs the LLM to stop generating as soon as this string is found\n",
    "- OutputParser: This determines how to parse the LLMOutput into an AgentAction or AgentFinish object\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLMAgent is used in an AgentExecutor. This AgentExecutor can largely be thought of as a loop that:\n",
    "1. Passes user input and any previous steps to the Agent (in this case, the LLMAgent)\n",
    "2. If the Agent returns an `AgentFinish`, then return that directly to the user\n",
    "3. If the Agent returns an `AgentAction`, then use that to call a tool and get an `Observation`\n",
    "4. Repeat, passing the `AgentAction` and `Observation` back to the Agent until an `AgentFinish` is emitted.\n",
    "    \n",
    "`AgentAction` is a response that consists of `action` and `action_input`. `action` refers to which tool to use, and `action_input` refers to the input to that tool. `log` can also be provided as more context (that can be used for logging, tracing, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "`AgentFinish` is a response that contains the final message to be sent back to the user. This should be used to end an agent run.\n",
    "        \n",
    "In this notebook we walk through how to create a custom LLM agent."
