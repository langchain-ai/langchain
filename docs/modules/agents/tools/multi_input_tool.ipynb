    "# Multi-Input Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use a tool that requires multiple inputs with an agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty in doing so comes from the fact that an agent decides its next step from a language model, which outputs a string. So if that step requires multiple inputs, they need to be parsed from that. Therefore, the currently supported way to do this is to write a smaller wrapper function that parses a string into multiple inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a concrete example, let's work on giving an agent access to a multiplication function, which takes as input two integers. In order to use this, we will tell the agent to generate the \"Action Input\" as a comma-separated list of length two. We will then write a thin wrapper that takes a string, splits it into two around a comma, and passes both parsed sides as integers to the multiplication function."
