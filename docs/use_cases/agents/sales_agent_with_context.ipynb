    "This notebook demonstrates an implementation of a **Context-Aware** AI Sales agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was originally published at [filipmichalsky/SalesGPT](https://github.com/filip-michalsky/SalesGPT) by [@FilipMichalsky](https://twitter.com/FilipMichalsky).\n",
    "\n",
    "SalesGPT is context-aware, which means it can understand what section of a sales conversation it is in and act accordingly.\n",
    " \n",
    "As such, this agent can have a natural sales conversation with a prospect and behaves based on the conversation stage. Hence, this notebook demonstrates how we can use AI to automate sales development representatives activites, such as outbound sales calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "We leverage the [`langchain`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) library in this implementation and are inspired by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) architecture ."
