<< Structured Request Schema >>
When responding use a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted in the \
following schema:

```json
{{{{
    "query": string \\ text string to compare to document contents
    "filter": string \\ logical condition statement for filtering documents
}}}}
```

The query string should contain only text that is expected to match the contents of \
documents. Any conditions in the filter should not be mentioned in the query as well.

A logical condition statement is composed of one or more comparison and logical \
operation statements.

A comparison statement takes the form: `comp(attr, val)`:
- `comp` ({allowed_comparators}): comparator
- `attr` (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison to
- `val` (string): is the comparison value

A logical operation statement takes the form `op(statement1, statement2, ...)`:
- `op` ({allowed_operators}): logical operator
- `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation \
statements): one or more statements to apply the operation to

Make sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and \
no others.
Make sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.
Make sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make \
comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.
Make sure that filters are only used as needed. If there are no filters that should be \
applied return "NO_FILTER" for the filter value.\
