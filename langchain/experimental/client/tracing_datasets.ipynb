    "# Running Chains on Traced Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing applications with language models can be uniquely challenging. To manage this complexity and ensure reliable performance, LangChain provides tracing and evaluation functionality. This notebook demonstrates how to run Chains, which are language model functions, as well as Chat models, and LLMs on previously captured datasets or traces. Some common use cases for this approach include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Running an evaluation chain to grade previous runs.\n",
    "- Comparing different chains, LLMs, and agents on traced datasets.\n",
    "- Executing a stochastic chain multiple times over a dataset to generate metrics before deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this notebook assumes you have LangChain+ tracing running in the background. It is also configured to work only with the V2 endpoints. To set it up, follow the [tracing directions here](..\\/..\\/tracing\\/local_installation.md).\n",
