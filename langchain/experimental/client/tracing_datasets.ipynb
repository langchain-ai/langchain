    "# Tracing and Datasets with LangChainPlus\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain makes it easy to get started with Agents and other LLM applications. However, it can be tricky to get right, especially when you need to deliver a full product. To speed up your application development process, and to help monitor your applications in production, LangChain offers additional tracing and tooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "When might you want to use tracing? Some situations we've found it useful include:\n",
    "- Quickly debugging a new chain, agent, or set of tools\n",
    "- Evaluating a given chain across different LLMs or Chat Models to compare results or improve prompts\n",
    "- Running a given chain multiple time on a dataset to ensure it consistently meets a quality bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll show how to enable tracing in your LangChain applications and walk you a couple common ways to evaluate your agents.\n",
    "We'll focus on using Datasets to benchmark Chain behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bear in mind that this notebook is designed under the assumption that you're running the latest LangChain+ server locally in the background. This is done using the folowing command in your terminal:**\n",
