      # We explicitly *don't* set up caching here. This ensures our tests are
      # maximally sensitive to catching breakage.
      #
      # For example, here's a way that caching can cause a falsely-passing test:
      # - Make the langchain package manifest no longer list a dependency package
      #   as a requirement. This means it won't be installed by `pip install`,
      #   and attempting to use it would cause a crash.
      # - That dependency used to be required, so it may have been cached.
      #   When restoring the venv packages from cache, that dependency gets included.
      # - Tests pass, because the dependency is present even though it wasn't specified.
      # - The package is published, and it breaks on the missing dependency when
      #   used in the real world.

        #   are not found on test PyPI can be resolved and installed anyway.
