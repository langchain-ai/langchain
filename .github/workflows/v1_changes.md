With the deprecation of v0 docs, the following files will need to be migrated/supported
in the new docs repo:

- run_notebooks.yml: New repo should run Integration tests on code snippets?
- people.yml: Need to fix and somehow display on the new docs site
  - Subsequently, `.github/actions/people/`
- _test_doc_imports.yml
- check_new_docs.yml
- check-broken-links.yml
