  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows to trigger the workflow manually in GitHub UI

# If another push to the same PR or branch happens while this workflow is still running,
# cancel the earlier run in favor of the next run.
#
# There's no point in testing an outdated version of the code. GitHub only allows
# a limited number of job runners to be active at the same time, so it's better to cancel
# pointless jobs early so that more useful jobs can run sooner.
