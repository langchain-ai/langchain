        # since the previous action step just created them.

          # Important considerations:
          # - These commands run at base of the repo, since we never `cd` to the `WORKDIR`.
          # - We only want to alter mtimes for Python files, since that's all black checks.
          # - We don't need to alter mtimes for directories, since black doesn't look at those.
          # - We also only alter mtimes inside the `WORKDIR` since that's all we'll lint.
          # - This should run before `poetry install`, because poetry's venv also contains
          #   Python files, and we don't want to alter their mtimes since they aren't linted.

          # After `git-restore-mtime`, such files have a mtime set to the oldest fetched commit.
          #
          # As new commits get added, that timestamp will keep moving forward.
          # If left unchanged, this will make `black` think that the files were edited
          # more recently than its cache suggests. Instead, we can set their mtime
          # to a fixed date in the far past that won't change and won't cause cache misses in black.

          # For all workdir Python files modified in or before the oldest few fetched commits,
