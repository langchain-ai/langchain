        Please add a self-contained, [minimal, reproducible, example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) with your use case.
        
        If a maintainer can copy it, run it, and see it right away, there's a much higher chance that you'll be able to get help.
        
        **Important!** 
        
        * Use code tags (e.g., ```python ... ```) to correctly [format your code](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#syntax-highlighting).
        * INCLUDE the language label (e.g. `python`) after the first three backticks to enable syntax highlighting. (e.g., ```python rather than ```).
        * Reduce your code to the minimum required to reproduce the issue if possible. This makes it much easier for others to help you.
        * Avoid screenshots when possible, as they are hard to read and (more importantly) don't allow others to copy-and-paste your code.

        The following code: 
        
        ```python
        from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda

        def bad_code(inputs) -> int:
          raise NotImplementedError('For demo purpose')
          
          chain = RunnableLambda(bad_code)
          chain.invoke('Hello!')
        ```

        Please share your system info with us. 
        
        "pip freeze | grep langchain" 
        platform (windows / linux / mac)
        python version
        
        OR if you're on a recent version of langchain-core you can paste the output of:
        
        python -m langchain_core.sys_info
      placeholder: |
        "pip freeze | grep langchain"
        platform
        python version
        
        Alternatively, if you're on a recent version of langchain-core you can paste the output of:
        
        python -m langchain_core.sys_info
        
        These will only surface LangChain packages, don't forget to include any other relevant
        packages you're using (if you're not sure what's relevant, you can paste the entire output of `pip freeze`).
