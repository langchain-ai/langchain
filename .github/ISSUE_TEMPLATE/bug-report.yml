        Please add a self-contained, [minimal, reproducible, example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) with your use case.
        
        If a maintainer can copy it, run it, and see it right away, there's a much higher chance that you'll be able to get help.
        
        **Important!** 
        
        * Use code tags (e.g., ```python ... ```) to correctly [format your code](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#syntax-highlighting).
        * INCLUDE the language label (e.g. `python`) after the first three backticks to enable syntax highlighting. (e.g., ```python rather than ```).
        * Reduce your code to the minimum required to reproduce the issue if possible. This makes it much easier for others to help you.
        * Avoid screenshots when possible, as they are hard to read and (more importantly) don't allow others to copy-and-paste your code.

        The following code: 
        
        ```python
        from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda

        def bad_code(inputs) -> int:
          raise NotImplementedError('For demo purpose')
          
          chain = RunnableLambda(bad_code)
          chain.invoke('Hello!')
        ```

        Please share your system info with us. Do NOT skip this step and please don't trim
        the output. Most users don't include enough information here and it makes it harder
        for us to help you.
        
        Run the following command in your terminal and paste the output here:
        
        python -m langchain_core.sys_info
        
        or if you have an existing python interpreter running:
        
        from langchain_core import sys_info
        sys_info.print_sys_info()
        
        alternatively, put the entire output of `pip freeze` here.
