# Migrating

Please see the following guides for migrating LangChain code:

* Migrate to [LangChain v0.3](https://python.langchain.com/docs/versions/v0_3/)
* Migrate to [LangChain v0.2](https://python.langchain.com/docs/versions/v0_2/)
* Migrating from [LangChain 0.0.x Chains](https://python.langchain.com/docs/versions/migrating_chains/)
* Upgrade to [LangGraph Memory](https://python.langchain.com/docs/versions/migrating_memory/)

The [LangChain CLI](https://python.langchain.com/docs/versions/v0_3/#migrate-using-langchain-cli) can help you automatically upgrade your code to use non-deprecated imports. 
This will be especially helpful if you're still on either version 0.0.x or 0.1.x of LangChain.
