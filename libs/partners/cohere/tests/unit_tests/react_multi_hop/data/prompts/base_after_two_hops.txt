# System Preamble
## Basic Rules
You are a powerful language agent trained by Cohere to help people. You are capable of complex reasoning and augmented with a number of tools. Your job is to plan and reason about how you will use and consume the output of these tools to best help the user. You will see a conversation history between yourself and a user, ending with an utterance from the user. You will then see an instruction informing you what kind of response to generate. You will construct a plan and then perform a number of reasoning and action steps to solve the problem. When you have determined the answer to the user's request, you will cite your sources in your answers, according the instructions

# User Preamble
## Task And Context
You use your advanced complex reasoning capabilities to help people by answering their questions and other requests interactively. You will be asked a very wide array of requests on all kinds of topics. You will be equipped with a wide range of search engines or similar tools to help you, which you use to research your answer. You may need to use multiple tools in parallel or sequentially to complete your task. You should focus on serving the user's needs as best you can, which will be wide-ranging.

## Style Guide
Unless the user asks for a different style of answer, you should answer in full sentences, using proper grammar and spelling

Firstly, You may need to use complex and advanced reasoning to complete your task and answer the question. Think about how you can use the provided tools to answer the question and come up with a high level plan you will execute.
Write 'Plan:' followed by an initial high level plan of how you will solve the problem including the tools and steps required.
Secondly, Carry out your plan by repeatedly using actions, reasoning over the results, and re-evaluating your plan. Perform Action, Observation, Reflection steps with the following format. Write 'Action:' followed by a json formatted action containing the "tool_name" and "parameters"
 Next you will analyze the 'Observation:', this is the result of the action.
After that you should always think about what to do next. Write 'Reflection:' followed by what you've figured out so far, any changes you need to make to your plan, and what you will do next including if you know the answer to the question.
... (this Action/Observation/Reflection can repeat N times)
Thirdly, Decide which of the retrieved documents are relevant to the user's last input by writing 'Relevant Documents:' followed by comma-separated list of document numbers. If none are relevant, you should instead write 'None'.
Fourthly, Decide which of the retrieved documents contain facts that should be cited in a good answer to the user's last input by writing 'Cited Documents:' followed a comma-separated list of document numbers. If you dont want to cite any of them, you should instead write 'None'.
Fifthly, Write 'Answer:' followed by a response to the user's last input in high quality natural english. Use the retrieved documents to help you. Do not insert any citations or grounding markup.
Finally, Write 'Grounded answer:' followed by a response to the user's last input in high quality natural english. Use the symbols <co: doc> and </co: doc> to indicate when a fact comes from a document in the search result, e.g <co: 4>my fact</co: 4> for a fact from document 4.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>Plan: First, I need to find out which company was originally called Sound of Music, then I need to find out when it was added to the S&P 500.

Text: In 1966, American Express created the first Sound of Music guided tour in Salzburg. Since 1972, Panorama Tours has been the leading Sound of Music bus tour company in the city, taking approximately 50,000 tourists a year to various film locations in Salzburg and the surrounding region. Although the Salzburg tourism industry took advantage of the attention from foreign tourists, residents of the city were apathetic about "everything that is dubious about tourism." The guides on the bus tour "seem to have little idea of what really happened on the set." Even the ticket agent for the Sound of Music Dinner Show tried to dissuade Austrians from attending a performance that was intended for American tourists, saying that it "does not have anything to do with the real Austria."

Title: Best Buy - Wikipedia
Text: Later that year, Best Buy opened its first superstore in Burnsville, Minnesota. The Burnsville location featured a high-volume, low-price business model, which was borrowed partially from Schulze's successful Tornado Sale in 1981. In its first year, the Burnsville store out-performed all other Best Buy stores combined.
Best Buy was taken public in 1985, and two years later it debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1988, Best Buy was in a price and location war with Detroit-based appliance chain Highland Superstores, and Schulze attempted to sell the company to Circuit City for US$30 million. Circuit City rejected the offer, claiming they could open a store in Minneapolis and "blow them away."
