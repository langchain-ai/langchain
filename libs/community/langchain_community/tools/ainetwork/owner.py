Rules for `owner` in AINetwork Blockchain database.
An address set as `owner` can modify permissions according to its granted authorities

## Path Rule
- (/[a-zA-Z_0-9]+)+
- Permission checks ascend from the most specific (child) path to broader (parent) paths until an `owner` is located.

## Address Rules
- 0x[0-9a-fA-F]{40}: 40-digit hexadecimal address
- *: All addresses permitted
- Defaults to the current session's address

## SET
- `SET` alters permissions for specific addresses, while other addresses remain unaffected.
- When removing an address of `owner`, set all authorities for that address to false.
- message `write_owner permission evaluated false` if fail

### Example
- type: SET
- path: /apps/langchain
- address: [<address 1>, <address 2>]
- write_owner: True
- write_rule: True
- write_function: True
- branch_owner: True

## GET
- Provides all addresses with `owner` permissions and their authorities in the path.

### Example
- type: GET
- path: /apps/langchain
