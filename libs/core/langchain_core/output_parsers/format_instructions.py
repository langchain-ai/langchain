JSON_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Return only the JSON value that conforms to the schema. Do not include any additional text, explanations, headings, or separators.
- Do not wrap the JSON in Markdown or code fences (no ``` or ```json).
- Do not prepend or append any text (e.g., do not write "Here is the JSON:").
- The response must be a single top-level JSON value exactly as required by the schema (object/array/etc.), with no trailing commas or comments.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}} the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema (shown in a code block for readability only â€” do not include any backticks or Markdown in your output):
```
{schema}
```"""  # noqa: E501
