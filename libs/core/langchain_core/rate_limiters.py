    Usage of the base limiter is through the acquire and aacquire methods depending
    on whether running in a sync or async context.

    Implementations are free to add a timeout parameter to their initialize method
    to allow users to specify a timeout for acquiring the necessary tokens when
    using a blocking call.

    Current limitations:

    - Rate limiting information is not surfaced in tracing or callbacks. This means
      that the total time it takes to invoke a chat model will encompass both
      the time spent waiting for tokens and the time spent making the request.

class InMemoryRateLimiter(BaseRateLimiter):
    """An in memory rate limiter based on a token bucket algorithm.

    This is an in memory rate limiter, so it cannot rate limit across
    different processes.

    The rate limiter only allows time-based rate limiting and does not
    take into account any information about the input or the output, so it
    cannot be used to rate limit based on the size of the request.

    It is thread safe and can be used in either a sync or async context.

    The in memory rate limiter is based on a token bucket. The bucket is filled
    with tokens at a given rate. Each request consumes a token. If there are
    not enough tokens in the bucket, the request is blocked until there are
    enough tokens.

    These *tokens* have NOTHING to do with LLM tokens. They are just
    a way to keep track of how many requests can be made at a given time.

    Current limitations:

    - The rate limiter is not designed to work across different processes. It is
      an in-memory rate limiter, but it is thread safe.
    - The rate limiter only supports time-based rate limiting. It does not take
      into account the size of the request or any other factors.

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            import time

            from langchain_core.rate_limiters import InMemoryRateLimiter

            rate_limiter = InMemoryRateLimiter(

                check_every_n_seconds=0.1,  # Wake up every 100 ms to check whether allowed to make a request,
                max_bucket_size=10,  # Controls the maximum burst size.
