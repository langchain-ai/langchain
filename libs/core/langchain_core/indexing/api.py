    """Index data from the loader into the vector store.

    Indexing functionality uses a manager to keep track of which documents
    are in the vector store.

    This allows us to keep track of which documents were updated, and which
    documents were deleted, which documents should be skipped.

    For the time being, documents are indexed using their hashes, and users
     are not able to specify the uid of the document.

    Important:
       * In full mode, the loader should be returning
         the entire dataset, and not just a subset of the dataset.
         Otherwise, the auto_cleanup will remove documents that it is not
         supposed to.
       * In incremental mode, if documents associated with a particular
         source id appear across different batches, the indexing API
         will do some redundant work. This will still result in the
         correct end state of the index, but will unfortunately not be
         100% efficient. For example, if a given document is split into 15
         chunks, and we index them using a batch size of 5, we'll have 3 batches
         all with the same source id. In general, to avoid doing too much
         redundant work select as big a batch size as possible.
        * The `scoped_full` mode is suitable if determining an appropriate batch size
          is challenging or if your data loader cannot return the entire dataset at
          once. This mode keeps track of source IDs in memory, which should be fine
          for most use cases. If your dataset is large (10M+ docs), you will likely
          need to parallelize the indexing process regardless.

    Args:
        docs_source: Data loader or iterable of documents to index.
        record_manager: Timestamped set to keep track of which documents were
                         updated.
        vector_store: VectorStore or DocumentIndex to index the documents into.
        batch_size: Batch size to use when indexing. Default is 100.
        cleanup: How to handle clean up of documents. Default is None.
            - incremental: Cleans up all documents that haven't been updated AND
                           that are associated with source ids that were seen
                           during indexing.
                           Clean up is done continuously during indexing helping
                           to minimize the probability of users seeing duplicated
                           content.
            - full: Delete all documents that have not been returned by the loader
                    during this run of indexing.
                    Clean up runs after all documents have been indexed.
                    This means that users may see duplicated content during indexing.
            - scoped_full: Similar to Full, but only deletes all documents
                           that haven't been updated AND that are associated with
                           source ids that were seen during indexing.
            - None: Do not delete any documents.
        source_id_key: Optional key that helps identify the original source
            of the document. Default is None.
        cleanup_batch_size: Batch size to use when cleaning up documents.
            Default is 1_000.
        force_update: Force update documents even if they are present in the
            record manager. Useful if you are re-indexing with updated embeddings.
            Default is False.
        key_encoder: Hashing algorithm to use for hashing the document content and
            metadata. Default is "sha1".
            Other options include "blake2b", "sha256", and "sha512".

        key_encoder: Hashing algorithm to use for hashing the document.
            If not provided, a default encoder using SHA-1 will be used.

            When changing the key encoder, you must change the
            index as well to avoid duplicated documents in the cache.
        upsert_kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to pass to the add_documents
                       method of the VectorStore or the upsert method of the
                       DocumentIndex. For example, you can use this to

    """Async index data from the loader into the vector store.

    Indexing functionality uses a manager to keep track of which documents
    are in the vector store.

    This allows us to keep track of which documents were updated, and which
    documents were deleted, which documents should be skipped.

    For the time being, documents are indexed using their hashes, and users
     are not able to specify the uid of the document.

    Important:
       * In full mode, the loader should be returning
         the entire dataset, and not just a subset of the dataset.
         Otherwise, the auto_cleanup will remove documents that it is not
         supposed to.
       * In incremental mode, if documents associated with a particular
         source id appear across different batches, the indexing API
         will do some redundant work. This will still result in the
         correct end state of the index, but will unfortunately not be
         100% efficient. For example, if a given document is split into 15
         chunks, and we index them using a batch size of 5, we'll have 3 batches
         all with the same source id. In general, to avoid doing too much
         redundant work select as big a batch size as possible.
       * The `scoped_full` mode is suitable if determining an appropriate batch size
         is challenging or if your data loader cannot return the entire dataset at
         once. This mode keeps track of source IDs in memory, which should be fine
         for most use cases. If your dataset is large (10M+ docs), you will likely
         need to parallelize the indexing process regardless.

    Args:
        docs_source: Data loader or iterable of documents to index.
        record_manager: Timestamped set to keep track of which documents were
                         updated.
        vector_store: VectorStore or DocumentIndex to index the documents into.
        batch_size: Batch size to use when indexing. Default is 100.
        cleanup: How to handle clean up of documents. Default is None.
            - incremental: Cleans up all documents that haven't been updated AND
                           that are associated with source ids that were seen
                           during indexing.
                           Clean up is done continuously during indexing helping
                           to minimize the probability of users seeing duplicated
                           content.
            - full: Delete all documents that haven to been returned by the loader.
                    Clean up runs after all documents have been indexed.
                    This means that users may see duplicated content during indexing.
            - scoped_full: Similar to Full, but only deletes all documents
                           that haven't been updated AND that are associated with
                           source ids that were seen during indexing.
            - None: Do not delete any documents.
        source_id_key: Optional key that helps identify the original source
            of the document. Default is None.
        cleanup_batch_size: Batch size to use when cleaning up documents.
            Default is 1_000.
        force_update: Force update documents even if they are present in the
            record manager. Useful if you are re-indexing with updated embeddings.
            Default is False.
        key_encoder: Hashing algorithm to use for hashing the document.
            If not provided, a default encoder using SHA-1 will be used.
            SHA-1 is not collision-resistant, and a motivated attacker
            could craft two different texts that hash to the
            same cache key.

            New applications should use one of the alternative encoders
            or provide a custom and strong key encoder function to avoid this risk.

            When changing the key encoder, you must change the
            index as well to avoid duplicated documents in the cache.
        upsert_kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to pass to the aadd_documents
                       method of the VectorStore or the aupsert method of the
                       DocumentIndex. For example, you can use this to
                       specify a custom vector_field:
                       upsert_kwargs={"vector_field": "embedding"}
            .. versionadded:: 0.3.10

    Returns:
        Indexing result which contains information about how many documents
        were added, updated, deleted, or skipped.

    Raises:

        ValueError: If cleanup mode is incremental and source_id_key is None.
        ValueError: If vectorstore does not have
