## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

## ü§î What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**‚ùì Question answering with RAG**

- [Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/)
- End-to-end Example: [Chat LangChain](https://chat.langchain.com) and [repo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/chat-langchain)

**üß± Extracting structured output**

- [Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/extraction/)
- End-to-end Example: [SQL Llama2 Template](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-extract/)

**ü§ñ Chatbots**

- [Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/chatbot/)
- End-to-end Example: [Web LangChain (web researcher chatbot)](https://weblangchain.vercel.app) and [repo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/weblangchain)

## üìñ Documentation

Please see [our full documentation](https://python.langchain.com) on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)
- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)
- Reference (full API docs)
- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

## üöÄ What can this help with?

There are five main areas that LangChain is designed to help with.
These are, in increasing order of complexity:

**üìÉ Models and Prompts:**

This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with chat models and LLMs.

**üîó Chains:**

Chains go beyond a single LLM call and involve sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.

**üìö Retrieval Augmented Generation:**

Retrieval Augmented Generation involves specific types of chains that first interact with an external data source to fetch data for use in the generation step. Examples include summarization of long pieces of text and question/answering over specific data sources.

**ü§ñ Agents:**

Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end-to-end agents.

**üßê Evaluation:**

Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.

## üíÅ Contributing

As an open-source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open to contributions, whether it be in the form of a new feature, improved infrastructure, or better documentation.
