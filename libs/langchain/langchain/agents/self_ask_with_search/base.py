            name `Intermediate Answer`
        prompt: The prompt to use, must have input key `agent_scratchpad` which will
            contain agent actions and tool outputs.

    Returns:
        A Runnable sequence representing an agent. It takes as input all the same input
        variables as the prompt passed in does. It returns as output either an
        AgentAction or AgentFinish.

    Examples:

        .. code-block:: python

            from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatAnthropic

    Prompt:

        The prompt must have input key `agent_scratchpad` which will
            contain agent actions and tool outputs as a string.
