The question the human asked the AI model was: If laid the Statue of Liberty end to end, how many times would it stretch across the United States?

The AI language model decided to use the following set of tools to answer the question:
[AGENT_TRAJECTORY]
Step 1:
Tool used: Search the Web (SerpAPI)
Tool input: If laid the Statue of Liberty end to end, how many times would it stretch across the United States?
Tool output: The Statue of Liberty was given to the United States by France, as a symbol of the two countries' friendship. It was erected atop an American-designed ...

[RESPONSE]
The AI language model's final answer to the question was: There are different ways to measure the length of the United States, but if we use the distance between the Statue of Liberty and the westernmost point of the contiguous United States (Cape Alava, Washington), which is approximately 2,857 miles (4,596 km), and assume that the Statue of Liberty is 305 feet (93 meters) tall, then the statue would stretch across the United States approximately 17.5 times if laid end to end.

EXAMPLE_OUTPUT = """First, let's evaluate the final answer. The final uses good reasoning but is wrong. 2,857 divided by 305 is not 17.5.\
The model should have used the calculator to figure this out. Second does the model use a logical sequence of tools to answer the question?\
The way model uses the search is not helpful. The model should have used the search tool to figure the width of the US or the height of the statue.\
The model didn't use the calculator tool and gave an incorrect answer. The search API should be used for current events or specific questions.\
The tools were not used in a helpful way. The model did not use too many steps to answer the question.\
The model did not use the appropriate tools to answer the question.\
    
Judgment: Given the good reasoning in the final answer but otherwise poor performance, we give the model a score of 2.

Score: 2"""
