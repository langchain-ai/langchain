## 📕 Releases & Versioning

See our [Releases](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/release-policy) and [Versioning](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/versioning) policies.

We encourage pinning your version to a specific version in order to avoid breaking your CI when we publish new tests. We recommend upgrading to the latest version periodically to make sure you have the latest tests.

Not pinning your version will ensure you always have the latest tests, but it may also break your CI if we introduce tests that your integration doesn't pass.

As an open-source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open to contributions, whether it be in the form of a new feature, improved infrastructure, or better documentation.
