"""Base Test classes for standard testing.

To learn how to use these classes, see the
`integration standard testing <https://python.langchain.com/docs/contributing/how_to/integrations/standard_tests/>`__
guide.

This package provides both the original test suites and the v1 test suites that support
the new content blocks system introduced in ``langchain_core.messages.content_blocks``.
