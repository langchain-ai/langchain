In the context, short-term memory is described as the in-context learning that allows the model to learn.\\n\\n2. Long-term memory: It refers to the capability of the agent to retain and recall information over extended periods. In the context, long-term memory is described as the ability to retain and recall infinite information by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\nIt's important to note that these are just the types of memory mentioned in the given context.
