### Quick Start Example

```python
from ticket_broker import TicketBrokerOptimizer

# Initialize the system
optimizer = TicketBrokerOptimizer()

# Define an event to analyze
event_data = {
    'artist_name': 'Taylor Swift',
    'venue_name': 'Madison Square Garden',
    'venue_city': 'New York',
    'venue_state': 'NY',
    'event_date': '2024-06-15T20:00:00Z',
    'on_sale_date': '2024-03-01T10:00:00Z',
    'face_value_min': 75.0,
    'face_value_max': 300.0,
    'tour_name': 'Eras Tour'
}

# Perform quick decision check (60 seconds)
quick_decision = optimizer.quick_decision_framework(
    event_data['artist_name'],
    event_data['venue_name'],
    event_data['venue_city'],
    event_data['event_date']
)

print(f"Quick Decision: {quick_decision['decision']}")
print(f"Reasoning: {quick_decision['reasoning']}")

# Perform full analysis (if quick check is positive)
if quick_decision['decision'] in ['proceed_with_analysis', 'investigate_further']:
    recommendation = optimizer.analyze_event(event_data)
    
    print(f"\nRecommendation: {recommendation.recommendation.value}")
    print(f"Total Score: {recommendation.total_score}")
    print(f"Confidence: {recommendation.confidence_score:.1%}")
    print(f"Expected Profit Margin: {recommendation.expected_profit_margin:.1%}")
    print(f"Max Investment: ${recommendation.max_recommended_investment:,.2f}")
    print(f"Reasoning: {recommendation.reasoning}")
```

### Advanced Usage

#### 1. Analyze Multiple Events
```python
events = [event1_data, event2_data, event3_data]
recommendations = optimizer.analyze_multiple_events(events)

# Results are automatically sorted by priority
for rec in recommendations:
    print(f"{rec.recommendation.value}: Score {rec.total_score}")
```

#### 2. Search and Analyze Artist Tours
```python
# Find and analyze all upcoming shows for an artist
recommendations = optimizer.search_and_analyze_artist_tours("Billie Eilish")

for rec in recommendations:
    if rec.recommendation.value in ['strong_buy', 'selective_buy']:
        print(f"Opportunity found: {rec.reasoning}")
```

#### 3. Monitor Upcoming On-Sales
```python
# Get upcoming on-sales for the next 7 days
priority_onsales = optimizer.get_upcoming_onsales_analysis(days_ahead=7)

print(f"Found {len(priority_onsales)} priority opportunities")
for opportunity in priority_onsales:
    print(f"- {opportunity.reasoning}")
```

#### 4. Generate Market Reports
```python
# Generate market report for a specific city
market_report = optimizer.generate_market_report(city="Los Angeles")

print("Hot Artists:", market_report['hot_artists'])
print("Upcoming Opportunities:", len(market_report['upcoming_opportunities']))
print("Market Recommendations:", market_report['recommendations'])
```

#### 5. Export Analysis Reports
```python
# Export detailed analysis to JSON
report_path = optimizer.export_analysis_report(recommendations)
print(f"Report saved to: {report_path}")
```
