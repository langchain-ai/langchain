    "### Why route chat messages through Kafka?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easier to interact with the LLM directly using LangChains built-in conversation management features. Plus you can also use a REST API to generate a response from an externally hosted model. So why go to the trouble of using Apache Kafka?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few reasons, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Integration**: Many enterprises want to run their own LLMs so that they can keep their data in-house. This requires integrating LLM-powered components into existing architectures that might already be decoupled using some kind of message bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Scalability**: Apache Kafka is designed with parallel processing in mind, so many teams prefer to use it to more effectively distribute work to available workers (in this case the \"worker\" is a container running an LLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Durability**: Kafka is designed to allow services to pick up where another service left off in the case where that service experienced a memory issue or went offline. This prevents data loss in highly complex, distributed architectures where multiple systems are communicating with one another (LLMs being just one of many interdependent systems that also include vector databases and traditional databases).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more background on why event streaming is a good fit for Gen AI application architecture, see Kai Waehner's article [\"Apache Kafka + Vector Database + LLM = Real-Time GenAI\"](https://www.kai-waehner.de/blog/2023/11/08/apache-kafka-flink-vector-database-llm-real-time-genai/)."
