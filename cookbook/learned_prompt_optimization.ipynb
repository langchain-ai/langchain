    "The rl_chain (reinforcement learning chain) provides a way to automatically determine the best terms to inject without the need for fine-tuning the underlying foundational model.\n",

    "For illustration, consider the scenario of a meal delivery service. We use LangChain to ask customers, like Tom, about their dietary preferences and recommend suitable meals from our extensive menu. The rl_chain selects a meal based on user preferences, injects it into a prompt template, and forwards the prompt to an LLM. The LLM's response, which is a personalized recommendation, is then returned to the user.\n",
