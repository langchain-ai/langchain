    "# SalesGPT - Your Context-Aware AI Sales Assistant With Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an implementation of a **Context-Aware** AI Sales agent with a Product Knowledge Base. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was originally published at [filipmichalsky/SalesGPT](https://github.com/filip-michalsky/SalesGPT) by [@FilipMichalsky](https://twitter.com/FilipMichalsky).\n",
    "\n",
    "SalesGPT is context-aware, which means it can understand what section of a sales conversation it is in and act accordingly.\n",
    " \n",
    "As such, this agent can have a natural sales conversation with a prospect and behaves based on the conversation stage. Hence, this notebook demonstrates how we can use AI to automate sales development representatives activities, such as outbound sales calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the AI Sales agent has access to tools, which allow it to interact with other systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we show how the AI Sales Agent can use a **Product Knowledge Base** to speak about a particular's company offerings,\n",
    "hence increasing relevance and reducing hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We leverage the [`langchain`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) library in this implementation, specifically [Custom Agent Configuration](https://langchain-langchain.vercel.app/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_agent_with_tool_retrieval) and are inspired by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) architecture ."
