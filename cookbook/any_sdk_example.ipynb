    "# How to use AnySDK to make a dynamic toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "AnySDK allows you to wrap any SDK client that exposes various CRUD operations (get, update, create, delete) and turn them into LLM-enabled toolkits without having to write a custom toolkit.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two core aspects to AnySDK:\n",
    "1. AnySDKWrapper -- wraps the SDK you pass in\n",
    "2. CrudControls -- allows you to control the access an agent has to Create, Read, Update, Delete verbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of writing, if you use Anthropic's Claude3 Haiku model in this notebook, it will cost less than USD 0.01 to complete."
