# ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain

Looking for the JS/TS library? Check out
[LangChain.js](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs).

LangChain is a framework for building LLM-powered applications. It helps you chain
together interoperable components and third-party integrations to simplify AI
application development ‚Äî  all while future-proofing decisions as the underlying
technology evolves.

```bash
pip install -U langchain
```

To learn more about LangChain, check out
[the docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/). If you‚Äôre looking for more
advanced customization or agent orchestration, check out
[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/), our framework for building
controllable agent workflows.

## Why use LangChain?

LangChain helps developers build applications powered by LLMs through a standard
interface for models, embeddings, vector stores, and more. 

Use LangChain for:
- **Real-time data augmentation**. Easily connect LLMs to diverse data sources and
external / internal systems, drawing from LangChain‚Äôs vast library of integrations with
model providers, tools, vector stores, retrievers, and more.
- **Model interoperability**. Swap models in and out as your engineering team
experiments to find the best choice for your application‚Äôs needs. As the industry
frontier evolves, adapt quickly ‚Äî LangChain‚Äôs abstractions keep you moving without
losing momentum.

## LangChain‚Äôs ecosystem
While the LangChain framework can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly
with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools when building LLM
applications. 

To improve your LLM application development, pair LangChain with:

- [LangSmith](http://www.langchain.com/langsmith) - Helpful for agent evals and
observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain
visibility in production, and improve performance over time.
- [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) - Build agents that can
reliably handle complex tasks with LangGraph, our low-level agent orchestration
framework. LangGraph offers customizable architecture, long-term memory, and
human-in-the-loop workflows ‚Äî and is trusted in production by companies like LinkedIn,
Uber, Klarna, and GitLab.
- [LangGraph Platform](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/#langgraph-platform) - Deploy
and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long
running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across
teams ‚Äî and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in
[LangGraph Studio](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_studio/).
