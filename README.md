# 🍄 Grow Some Mushrooms

A retro-styled physics-based game that combines garden growing mechanics with Angry Birds-style slingshot gameplay, featuring a classic Atari aesthetic.

## 🎮 Game Overview

**Grow Some Mushrooms** challenges players to use a slingshot to launch spores onto fertile soil patches to grow mushrooms. Navigate around obstacles, avoid water hazards, and strategically plan your shots to complete each level with limited spores.

## 🕹️ How to Play

### Controls
- **Mouse Movement**: Aim the slingshot
- **Click**: Launch a spore
- **Reset Button**: Restart current level
- **Help Button**: View detailed instructions

### Objective
- Launch spores to hit all brown soil patches on each level
- Each soil patch that gets hit will grow a mushroom
- Complete levels by growing mushrooms on ALL soil patches
- Progress through increasingly challenging levels

### Game Elements

#### 🎯 **Targets**
- **Soil Patches** (Brown circles): Where mushrooms grow when hit by spores
- Hit all soil patches to complete the level

#### 🚀 **Projectiles**
- **Spores** (Green glowing circles): Your ammunition
- Limited number per level - use them wisely!
- Follow realistic physics with gravity and air resistance

#### 🛡️ **Obstacles**
- **Rocks** (Gray circles): Destroy spores on impact - avoid these!
- **Water Patches** (Blue circles): Wash away spores - steer clear!

#### 🏆 **Scoring**
- **100 points** per mushroom grown
- **Bonus points** for growing mushrooms near each other (mushroom colonies)
- Higher levels provide more challenges and scoring opportunities

## 🎨 Visual Features
