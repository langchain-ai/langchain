LangChain is a framework for building LLM-powered applications. It helps you chain together interoperable components and third-party integrations to simplify AI application development —  all while future-proofing decisions as the underlying technology evolves.

```bash
pip install -U langchain
```

**Documentation**: To learn more about LangChain, check out [the docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/).

If you're looking for more advanced customization or agent orchestration, check out [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/), our framework for building controllable agent workflows.

> [!NOTE]
> Looking for the JS/TS library? Check out [LangChain.js](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs).

## Why use LangChain?

LangChain helps developers build applications powered by LLMs through a standard interface for models, embeddings, vector stores, and more.

Use LangChain for:

- **Real-time data augmentation**. Easily connect LLMs to diverse data sources and external/internal systems, drawing from LangChain’s vast library of integrations with model providers, tools, vector stores, retrievers, and more.
- **Model interoperability**. Swap models in and out as your engineering team experiments to find the best choice for your application’s needs. As the industry frontier evolves, adapt quickly — LangChain’s abstractions keep you moving without losing momentum.

## LangChain’s ecosystem

While the LangChain framework can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools when building LLM applications.

To improve your LLM application development, pair LangChain with:

- [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith) - Helpful for agent evals and observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and improve performance over time.
- [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) - Build agents that can reliably handle complex tasks with LangGraph, our low-level agent orchestration framework. LangGraph offers customizable architecture, long-term memory, and human-in-the-loop workflows — and is trusted in production by companies like LinkedIn, Uber, Klarna, and GitLab.
- [LangGraph Platform](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform) - Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long-running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams — and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in [LangGraph Studio](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_studio/).
